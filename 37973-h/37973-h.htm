  <span class="hide">C</span>OLONEL TEMPEST and his miniature
ten-year-old replica of himself
had made themselves as comfortable as
circumstances would permit in opposite
corners of the smoking carriage. It was a
chilly morning in April, and the boy had
wrapped himself in his travelling rug, and
turned up his little collar, and drawn his
soft little travelling cap over his eyes in exact,
though unconscious, imitation of his father.<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
Colonel Tempest looked at him now and
then with paternal complacency. It is certainly
a satisfaction to see ourselves repeated
in our children. We feel that the type will
not be lost. Each new edition of ourselves
lessens a natural fear lest a work of value
and importance should lapse out of print.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest at forty was still very
handsome; and must, as a young man, have
possessed great beauty before the character
had had time to assert itself in the face;
before selfishness had learned to look out
of the clear grey eyes, and a weak self-indulgence
and irresolution had loosened the
well-cut lips.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest, as a rule, took life very
easily. If he had fits of uncontrolled passion
now and then, they were quickly over. If
his feelings were touched, that was quickly
over too. But to-day his face was clouded.
He had tried the usual antidotes for an<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
impending attack of what he would have
called "the blues," by which he meant any
species of reflection calculated to give him that
passing annoyance which was the deepest
form of emotion of which he was capable.
But <i>Punch</i> and the <i>Sporting Times</i>, and even
the comic French paper which Archie might
not look at, were powerless to distract him
to-day. At last he tossed the latter out
of the window to corrupt the morals of
trespassers on the line, and, as it was, after
all, less trouble to yield than to resist,
settled himself in his corner, and gave
way to a series of gloomy and anxious
reflections.</p>

<p>He was bent on a mission of importance
to his old home, to see his brother who
was dying. His mind always recoiled
instinctively from the thought of death, and
turned quickly to something else. It was
fourteen years since he had been at Overleigh,<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
fourteen years since that event had
taken place which had left a deadly enmity
of silence and estrangement between his
brother and himself ever since. And it
had all been about a woman. It seemed
extraordinary to Colonel Tempest, as he
looked back, that a quarrel which had led
to such serious consequences&mdash;which had,
as he remembered, spoilt his own life&mdash;should
have come from so slight a cause.
It was like losing the sight of an eye
because a fly had committed trespass in it.
A man's mental rank may generally be determined
by his estimate of woman. If he
stands low he considers her&mdash;heaven help
her&mdash;such an one as himself. If he climbs
high he takes his ideal of her along with
him, and, to keep it safe, places it above
himself.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest pursued the reflections
suggested by an untaxed intellect of ave<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>rage
calibre which he believed to be profound.
A mere girl! How men threw up
everything for women! What fools men
were when they were young! After all,
when he came to think of it, there had
been some excuse for him. (There generally
was.) How beautiful she had been
with her pale exquisite face, and her
innocent eyes, and a certain shy dignity
and pride of bearing peculiar to herself.
Yes, any other man would have done the
same in his place. The latter argument
had had great weight with Colonel Tempest
through life. He could not help it if she
were engaged to his brother. It was as
much her fault as his own if they fell in
love with each other. She was seventeen
and he was seven and twenty, but it is
always the woman who "has the greater
sin."</p>

<p>He remembered, with something like complacency,<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
the violent love-making of the
fortnight that followed, her shy adoration
of her beautiful eager lover. Then came
the scruples, the flight, the white cottage
by the Thames, the marriage at the local
register office. What a fool he had been,
he reflected, and how he had worshipped
her at first, before he had been disappointed
in her; disappointed in her as the boy is
in the butterfly when he has it safe&mdash;and
crushed&mdash;in his hand. She might have
made anything of him, he reflected. But
somehow there had been a hitch in her
character. She had not taken him the right
way. She had been unable to effect a radical
change in him, to convert weakness and
irresolution into strength and decision; and
he had been quite ready to have anything
of that sort done for him. During all those
early weeks of married life, until she caught
a heavy cold on her chest, he had believed<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
existence had been easily and delightfully
transformed for him. He was susceptible.
His feelings were always easily touched.
Everything influenced him, for a time;
beautiful music, or a pathetic story for half
an hour; his young wife for&mdash;nearly six
months.</p>

<p>A play usually ends with the wedding,
but there is generally an after-piece, ignored
by lovers but expected by an experienced
audience. The after-piece in Colonel Tempest's
domestic drama began with tears,
caused, I believe, in the first instance by a
difference of opinion as to who was responsible
for the earwigs in his bath sponge.
In the white cottage there were many earwigs.
But even after the earwig difficulty
was settled by a move to London, other
occasions seemed to crop up for the shedding
of those tears which are known to be
the common resource of women for obtaining<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
their own way when other means fail;
and others, many others, suggested by youth
and inexperience and a devoted love had
failed. If they are silent tears, or worse
still, if the eyelids betray that they have
been shed in secret, a man may with reason
become much annoyed at what looks like a
tacit reproach. Colonel Tempest became
annoyed. It is the good fortune of shallow
men so thoroughly to understand women,
that they can see through even the noblest
of them; though of course that deeper insight
into the hypocrisy practised by the
whole sex about their fancied ailments, and
inconveniently wounded feelings for their
own petty objects, is reserved for selfish
men alone.</p>

<p>Matters have become very wrong indeed,
when a caress is not enough to set all right
at once; but things came to that shocking
pass between Colonel and Mrs. Tempest,<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
and went in the course of the next few years
several steps further still, till they reached,
on her part, that dreary dead level of emaciated
semi-maternal tenderness, which is the
only feeling some husbands allow their wives
to entertain permanently for them; the only
kind of love which some men believe a
virtuous woman is capable of.</p>

<p>How he had suffered, he reflected, he who
needed love so much. Even the advent of
the child had only drawn them together for
a time. He remembered how deeply touched
he had been when it was first laid in his
arms, how drawn towards its mother. But
his smoking-room fire had been neglected
during the following week, and he could not
find any large envelopes, and the nurse made
absurd restrictions about his seeing his wife at
his own hours, and Di herself was feeble and
languid, and made no attempt to enter into his
feelings, or show him any sympathy, and<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest sighed as he made this
mournful retrospect of his married life. He
had never cared to be much at home, he
reflected. His home had not been made
very pleasant to him; the poor meagre home
in a dingy street, the wrong side of Oxford
Street, which was all that a young man in
the Guards, with expensive tastes, who had
quarrelled with his elder brother, could afford.
The last evening he had spent in that house
came back to him with a feeling of bitter
resentment at the recollection of his wife's
unreasonable distress when a tradesman
called after dinner for payment of a longstanding
account which she had understood
was settled. It was not a large bill he
remembered wrathfully, and he had intended
to keep his promise of paying it directly his
money came in, but when it came he had
needed it, and more, for his share of the
spring fishing he had taken cheap with a<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
friend. Naturally he would not see the
man whose loud voice, asking repeatedly
for him, could be heard in the hall, and who
refused to go away. Colonel Tempest had
a dislike to rows with tradespeople. At
last his wife, prostrate, and in feeble health,
rose languidly from her sofa, and went down
to meet the recriminations of the unfortunate
tradesman, who, after a long interval, retired,
slamming the door. Colonel Tempest heard
her slow step come up the stair again, and
then, instead of stopping at the drawing-room
door, it had gone toiling upwards to
the room above. He was incensed by so
distinct an evidence of temper. Surely, he
said to himself with exasperation, she knew
when she married him that she was marrying
a poor man.</p>

<p>She did not return: and at last he blew
out the lamp, and lighting the candle put
ready for him, went upstairs, and opening<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
the door of his wife's room, peered in. She
was sitting in the dark by the black fireplace
with her head in her hands. A great
deal of darkness and cold seemed to have
been compressed into that little room. She
raised her head as he came in. Her wide
eyes had a look in them of a dumb unreasoning
animal distress which took him
aback. There was no pride nor anger in
her face. In his ignorance he supposed
she would reproach him. He had not yet
realized that the day of reproaches and
appeals, very bitter while it lasted, was long
past, years past. The silence of those who
have loved us is sometimes eloquent as a
tombstone of that which has been buried
beneath it.</p>

<p>The room was very cold. A faint smell
of warm india-rubber and a molehill in the
middle of the bed showed that a hot bottle
was found more economical than coal.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>"Why on earth don't you have a fire?"
he asked, still standing in the doorway,
personally aggrieved at her economies. Di's
economies had often been the subject of sore
annoyance to him. An anxious housekeeper
in her teens sometimes retrenches in the
wrong place, namely where it is unpalatable
to the husband. Di had cured herself of
this fault of late years, but it cropped up now
and again, especially when he returned home
unexpectedly as to-day, and found only
mutton chops for dinner.</p>

<p>"It was the coal bill that the man came
about this evening," she said, apathetically,
and then the peculiar distressed look giving
place to a more human expression, as she
suddenly became aware of the reproach her
words implied, she added quickly, "but I
am not the least cold, thanks."</p>

<p>Still he lingered; a sense of ill-usage
generally needs expression.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>"Why did not you come back to the
drawing-room again?"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"I must say you have a knack of making
a man's home uncommonly pleasant for
him."</p>

<p>Still no answer. Perhaps there were none
left. One may come to an end of answers
sometimes, like other things&mdash;money, for
instance.</p>

<p>"Is my breakfast ordered for half-past
seven, sharp?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Poached eggs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and stewed kidneys. I hope they
will be right this time. And I've told
Martha to call you at seven punctually."</p>

<p>"All right. Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night."</p>

<p>That had been their parting in this world,
Colonel Tempest remembered bitterly, for<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
he had been too much hurried next morning
to run up to say good-bye before starting for
Scotland. Those had been the last words
his wife had spoken to him, the woman for
whom he had given up his liberty. So much
for woman's love and tenderness.</p>

<p>And as the train went heavily on its way,
he recalled, in spite of himself, the last
home-coming after that month's fishing, and
the fog that he shot into as he neared King's
Cross on that dull April morning six years
ago. He remembered his arrival at the
house, and letting himself in and going upstairs.
The house seemed strangely quiet.
In the drawing-room a woman was sitting
motionless in the gaslight. She looked up
as he came in, and he recognized the drawn,
haggard face of Mrs. Courtenay, his wife's
mother, whom he had never seen in his
house before, and who now spoke to him for
the first time since her daughter's marriage.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>"Is that you?" she said, quietly, her face
twitching. "I did not know where you
were. You have a daughter, Colonel Tempest,
of a few hours old."</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"And Di?" he asked. "Pretty comfortable?"</p>

<p>The question was a concession to custom
on Colonel Tempest's part, for, like others
of his enlightened views, he was of course
aware that the pains of childbirth are as
nothing compared to the twinge of gout in
the masculine toe.</p>

<p>"Diana," said the elder woman, with concentrated
passion, as she passed him to leave
the room&mdash;"Diana, thank God, is dead!"</p>

<p>He had never forgiven Mrs. Courtenay
for that speech. He remembered even now
with a shudder of acute self-pity all he had
gone through during the days that followed,
and the silent reproach of the face that even<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
in death wore a look not of rest, but of a
weariness stern and patient, and a courage
that has looked to the end and can wait.</p>

<p>And when Mrs. Courtenay had written to
offer to take the little Diana off his hands
altogether provided he would lay no claim
to her later on, he had refused with indignation.
He would not be parted from his
children. But the child was delicate and
wailed perpetually, and he wanted to get rid
of the house, and of all that reminded him
of a past that it was distinctly uncomfortable
to recall. He put the little yellow-haired
boy to school, and, when Mrs. Courtenay
repeated her offer, he accepted it; and Di,
with her bassinette and the minute feather-stitched
wardrobe that her mother had made
for her packed inside her little tin bath,
drove away one day in a four-wheeler straight
out of Colonel Tempest's existence and very
soon out of his memory.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>His marriage had been the ruin of him,
he said to himself, reviewing the last few
years. It had done for him with his brother.
He had been a fool to sacrifice so much for
a pretty face, and she had not had a shilling.
He had chucked away all his chances in
marrying her. He might have married
anybody; but he had never seen a woman
before or since with a turn of the neck and
shoulder to equal hers. Poor Di! She had
spoilt his life, no doubt, but she had had her
good points after all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Poor Di! Perhaps she too had had her
dark hours. Perhaps she had given love
to a man capable only of a passing passion.
Perhaps she had sold her woman's birthright
for red pottage, and had borne the penalty,
not with an exceeding bitter cry, but in an
exceeding bitter silence. Perhaps she had
struggled against the disillusion and desecration<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
of life, the despair and the self-loathing
that go to make up an unhappy marriage.
Perhaps in the deepening shadows of death
she had heard her new-born child cry to her
through the darkness, and had yearned over
it, and yet&mdash;and yet had been glad to go.</p>

<p>However these things may have been,
at any rate, she had a turn of the neck and
shoulder which lived in her husband's
memory. Poor Di!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Colonel Tempest shook himself free from
a train of reflections which had led him to
a death-bed, and suddenly remembered
with a shudder of repugnance that he was
on his way to another at this moment.</p>

<p>His brother had not sent for him.
Colonel Tempest was hazarding an unsolicited
visit. He had announced his
intention of coming, but he had received
no permission to do so. Nevertheless he<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
had actually screwed up his weak and
vacillating nature to the sticking point of
putting himself and his son into the train
when the morning arrived that he had
fixed on for going to Overleigh.</p>

<p>"For the sake of the old name, and for
the sake of the boy," he said to himself,
looking at the delicate regular profile silhouetted
against the window-pane. If
Archie had had a pair of wings folded
underneath his little great-coat, he would
have made a perfect model for an angel,
with his fair hair and face, and the sweet
serious eyes that contemplated, without any
change of expression, his choir book at
chapel, or the last grappling contortions of
a cockroach, ingeniously transfixed to the
book-ledge with a pin, to relieve the
monotony of the sermon.</p>

<p>"Overleigh! Overleigh! Overleigh!"
called out a porter, as the train stopped.<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
Colonel Tempest started. There already!
How long it was since he had got out at
that station! There was a new station-master,
and the station itself had been
altered. He looked at the little red tin
shelter erected on the off-side with an alien
eye. It had not been there in <i>his</i> time.
There was no carriage to meet him, although
he had mentioned the train by which he
intended to arrive. His heart sank a little
as he took Archie by the hand and set out
to walk. The distance was nothing, for the
station had been made specially for the convenience
of the Tempests, and lay within
a few hundred yards of the castle gates.
But the omen was a bad one. Would his
mission fail?</p>

<p>How unchanged everything was! He
seemed to remember every stone upon the
road. There was the turn up to the village,
and the low tower of the church peering<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
through the haze of the April trees. They
passed through the old Italian gates&mdash;there
was a new woman at the lodge to open
them&mdash;and entered the park. Archie drew
in his breath. He had never seen deer at
large before. He supposed his uncle must
keep a private zoological gardens on a large
scale, and his awe of him increased.</p>

<p>"Are the lions and the tigers loose too?"
he inquired, with grave interest, but without
anxiety, as his eyes followed a little
band of fallow deer skimming across the
turf.</p>

<p>"There are no lions and tigers, Archie,"
said his father, tightening his clasp on the
little hand. If Colonel Tempest had ever
loved anything, it was his son.</p>

<p>They had come to a turn in the broad
white road which he knew well. He stopped
and looked. High on a rocky crag, looking
out over its hanging woods and gardens, the<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
old grey castle stood, its long walls and
solemn towers outlined against the sky.
The flag was flying.</p>

<p>"He is still alive," said Colonel Tempest,
remembering a certain home-coming long
ago, when, as he galloped up the steep
winding drive, even as he rode, the flag
dropped half-mast high before his eyes, and
he knew his father was dead.</p>

<p>They had reached the ascent to the castle,
and Colonel Tempest turned from the broad
road, and struck into a little path that
clambered upwards towards the gardens
through the hanging woods. It was a short
cut to the house. It was here he had first
seen Diana, and he pondered over the
fidelity of mind which, after fourteen years,
could remember the exact spot. There was
the wooden bridge over the stream where
she had stood, her white gown reflected in
the water below her, the heart of the<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
summer woods enfolding her like the setting
of a jewel. The seringa and the laburnum
were out. The air was faint with perfume.
She stood looking at him with lovely surprised
eyes, in her exceeding youth and
beauty. Involuntarily his mind turned from
that first meeting to the last parting seven
years later. The cold, dark, London bedroom,
the bowed figure in the low chair,
the fatigued smell of tepid india-rubber.
What a gulf between the radiant young girl
and the woman with the white exhausted
face! Alas! for the many parts a woman
may have to play in her time to one and
the same man. Colonel Tempest laughed
harshly to himself, and his powerful mind
reverted to the old refrain, "What fools men
are to marry."</p>

<p>It had been summer when he had seen
her first, but now it was early spring. The
woods were very silent. God was making<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
a special revelation in their heart, was turning
over one more page of His New Testament.
He had walked once again in His
garden, and at the touch of His feet, all
young sheaths and spears of growing things
were stirring and pressing up to do His
will. The larch had hastened to hang out
his pink tassels. The primroses had been
the first among the flowers to receive the
Divine message, and were repeating it
already in their own language to those
that had ears to hear it. The folded buds
of the anemones had heard the whisper
<i>Ephphatha</i>, and were opening one after
another their pure shy eyes. The arched
neck of the young bracken was showing
among the brown ancestors of last year.
The marsh marigolds thronged the water's
edge. Every battered dyke and rocky scar
was transfigured. God was once again
making all things new.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>Only a mole, high on its funeral twig, held
out tiny human hands, worn with honest
toil, to its Maker, in mute protest against a
steel death "that nature never made" for
little agriculturists. Death was still in the
world apparently, side by side with the
resurrection of the flowers. Archie paused
to glance contemptuously and shy a stick at
the corpse as he passed. It looked as if it
had not afforded much sport before it died.
Colonel Tempest puffed a little, for the
ascent was steep, and he was not so slim
as he had once been. He sat down on a
circular wooden seat round a yew tree
by the path. He began to dislike the
idea of going on. And, perhaps, after all,
he would be told by the servants that his
brother would not see him. Jack was quite
capable of making himself disagreeable to
the last. Really, on the whole, perhaps the
best course would be to go down the hill<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
again. It is always so much easier to go
down than to go up; so much pleasanter at
the moment to avoid what may be distasteful
to a sensitive mind.</p>

<p>"Archie," said Colonel Tempest.</p>

<p>The boy did not hear him. He was looking
intently at a little patch of ground near
the garden seat, which had evidently been
carefully laid out by a landscape-gardener
of about his own age. Every hair of grass
or weed had been scratched up within the
irregular wall of fir cones that bounded the
enclosure. Grey sand imported from a
distance, possibly from the brook, marked
winding paths therein, in course of completion.
A sunk bucket with a squirt in it,
indicated an intention, as yet unmatured,
to add a fountain to the natural beauties of
the site.</p>

<p>"You go in this way, father," said Archie,
grasping the situation with becoming gravity,<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
and pointing out the two oyster shells that
flanked the main entrance, "then you walk
round the lake. Look; he has got a duck
ready. Oh, dear! and see, father, here is
his name. I would have done it all in white
stones if it had been me. J. O. H. N.
John. Father, who is John?"</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest's temper was like a
curate's gun. You could never tell when it
might not go off, or in what direction. It
went off now with an explosion. It had
been at full cock all the morning.</p>

<p>"Who is John?" he repeated, fiercely
kicking the letters on the ground to right
and left. "You may well ask that. John is
a confounded interloper. He has no right
here. Damn John!"</p>

<p>Archie was following the parental boot
with anxious eyes. The tin duck was dinted
in on one side, and bulged out on the other
in a manner painful to behold. It would<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
certainly never swim again. The turn of
the squirt might come any moment. But
when his father began to say damn, Archie
had always found it better not to interfere.</p>

<p>"Come along, Archie," said Colonel
Tempest, furiously, "don't stand fooling
there," and he began to mount the path with
redoubled energy. All thought of turning
back was forgotten.</p>

<p>Archie looked back ruefully at the devastated
pleasure-grounds. The fir cone
boundary was knocked over at one corner.
All privacy was lost; anything might get
in now, and the duck, if she recovered, could
get out. It was much to be regretted.</p>

<p>"Poor damn John," said Archie, slipping
his hand into that of the grown-up child
whom he had for a father.</p>

<p>"Poor John!" echoed Colonel Tempest,
his temper evaporating a little, "I only wish
it <i>were</i> poor John; and not poor Archie.<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
That was <i>your</i> garden, Archie, do you hear,
my boy&mdash;yours, not his. And you shall
have it, too, if I can get it for you."</p>

<p>"I don't want it now," said Archie,
gravely; "you've spoilt it."</p>

<p class="centern">"And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Job</span>
xxi. 25.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="80" height="79" alt="A" />
<span class="hide">A</span> PROFOUND knowledge of human
nature enunciated the decree, "Thou
shalt not covet thy neighbour's <i>house</i>," and
relegated the neighbour's wife to a back seat
among the servants and live stock.</p>

<p>The intense love of a house, passing the
love even of prohibited women, is a passion
which those who "nightly pitch their moving
tents" in villas and hired dwellings, and
look upon heaven as their home, can hardly
imagine, and frequently regard with the
amused contempt of ignorance. But where<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
pride is a leading power the affections will
be generally found immediately in its wake.
In these days it is the fashion, especially of
the vulgar-minded well-born, to decry birth
as being of no account. Those who do so,
apparently fail to perceive that, by the very
fact of decrying it, they proclaim their own
innate lack of appreciation of those very
advantages of refinement, manners, and a
certain distinction and freemasonry of feeling,
which birth has evidently withheld from
them personally, but which, nevertheless,
birth alone can bestow. The strong hereditary
pride of race which is as natural a
result of time and fixed habitat as the forest
oak&mdash;which is bred in the bone and comes
out in the flesh from generation to generation&mdash;is
accompanied, as a rule, by a
passionate love, not of houses, but of <i>the</i>
house, the home, the eyrie, the one sacred
spot from which the race sprang.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[33]</span></p>

<p>Among the Tempests devotion to Overleigh
had been an hereditary instinct from
time immemorial. Other possessions, gifts
of royalty, or dowers of heiresses came
and went. Overleigh remained from generation
to generation. Scapegrace Tempests
squandered the family fortune, and mortgaged
the family properties, but others rose
up in their place, who, whatever else was
lost, kept fast hold on Overleigh. The old
castle on the crag had passed through many
vicissitudes. It had been originally built in
Edward II.'s time, and the remains of fortification,
and the immense thickness of the
outer walls, showed how fierce had been the
inroads of Scot and Borderer which such
strength was needed to repel. The massive
arched doorway through which the yelling
hordes of the Tempests and their retainers
swooped down, with black lion on pennant
flying, upon the enemy, was walled up in the<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
time of the Tudors, and the vaulted basement
with its acutely pointed chamfered arches
became the dungeons of the later portion of
the building; the cellars of the present day.</p>

<p>Overleigh had entertained royalty royally
in its time, and had sheltered royalty more
royally still. Cromwell's cannon had not
prevailed against it. It had been partially
burnt, it had been partially rebuilt. There
it still stood, a glory, and a princely possession
on the lands that had been meted in
the Doomsday book to a certain Norman
knight Ivo de Temp&ecirc;te, the founder of an
iron race. And in the nineteenth century
a Tempest held it still. Tempest had
become a great name. Gradually wealth
had gathered round Overleigh, as the lichen
had gathered round its grey stones. There
were coal-mines now among the marsh-lands
of William the Conqueror's favourite, harbours
and towns along the sea-coast. Tempest of<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
Overleigh was a power, a name that might
be felt, that had been felt. The name
ranked high among the great commoners of
England. Titles and honours of various
kinds had been offered it from time to time.
But for a Tempest, to be a Tempest was
enough. And Overleigh Castle had remained
their solitary dwelling-place. Houses
were built for younger sons, but the head of
the family made his home invariably at Overleigh
itself. There were town houses in
London and York, but country seats were not
multiplied. To be a Tempest was enough.
To live and die at Overleigh was enough.</p>

<p>Some one was dying at Overleigh now.
Mr. Tempest had come to that pass, and
was taking it very quietly, as he had taken
everything so far, from the elopement of his
betrothed with his brother fourteen years
ago, to the death of his poor, pretty faithless
wife in the room where he was now lying;<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
the round oak-panelled room, which followed
the outer wall of the western tower; the
room in which he had been born, where
Tempests had arrived and departed, and
lain in state. And now after a solitary life
he was dying, as he had lived, alone.</p>

<p>He had gone too far down the steep path
which leads no man knows whither, to care
much for anything that he was leaving
behind. He had not read his brother's
letter announcing his coming. It lay with
a pile of others for some one hereafter to
sort or burn. Mr. Tempest had done with
letters, had done with everything except
Death. The pressure of Death's hand was
heavy on him, upon his eyes, upon his heart.
He had been a punctual man all his life.
He hoped he should not be kept waiting
long.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Colonel Tempest followed the servant<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
with inward trepidation across the white
stone hall. He had been at once admitted,
for it was known that Mr. Tempest was
dying, and the only wonder in the minds
of nurse and doctor and servants was that
his only brother had not arrived before.
The servant led the way along the picture-gallery.
A child was playing at the further
end of it under the Velasquez; or, to speak
more correctly, was looking earnestly out of
one of the low mullioned windows. The
voice of the young year was calling him
from without, as the spring calls only the
young. But he might not go out to-day,
though there were nests waiting for him,
and holiday glories in wood and meadow
that his soul longed after. He had been told
he must stay in, in case that stern silent
father who was dying should ask for him.
John did not think he would want him, for
when had he ever wanted him yet? but he<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
remained at his post at the window, breathing
his silent longing into a little mist on the
pane.</p>

<p>He looked round as Colonel Tempest and
Archie approached, and then came gravely
forward, and put out a strong little brown
hand.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest just touched it without
speaking, and turned his eyes away. He
could not trust himself to look again at the
erect dignified little figure with its square
dark face. When had there ever been a
dark Tempest?</p>

<p>The two boys, near of an age, looked
each other straight in the eyes. Archie was
the younger and the taller of the two.</p>

<p>"Are you John?" he asked at once.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"John what?"</p>

<p>"No. John Amyas Tempest."</p>

<p>"Archie," said Colonel Tempest, who had<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
grown rather pale, "you can stay here with&mdash;&mdash;,
until I send for you." And with one
backward glance at them, he followed the
servant to an ante-room, where the doctor
presently came to him.</p>

<p>"I am his only brother," said Colonel
Tempest hoarsely. "Can I see him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear sir, certainly; but at
the same time all agitation, all tendency to
excitement, must be rigorously avoided."</p>

<p>"Is he really dying?" interrupted Colonel
Tempest.</p>

<p>"He is."</p>

<p>"How long has he?" Colonel Tempest
felt as if a hand were tightening round his
throat. The doctor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Three hours. Five hours. He might
live through the night. I cannot say."</p>

<p>"There would be time," said Colonel
Tempest to himself; and, not without a
shuddering foreboding that his brother might<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
die in his actual presence, without giving
him time to bolt, he entered the sick-room,
from which the doctor had beckoned the
nurse, and closed the door.</p>

<p>The room was full of light, for the dying
man had been oppressed by the darkness in
which he lay, and a vain attempt had been
made to alleviate it by the flood of April
sunshine which had been let into the room.
Through the open window came the rapture
of the birds.</p>

<p>Mr. Tempest lay perfectly motionless with
his eyes half closed. His worn face had a
strong family resemblance to his brother's,
with the beauty left out.</p>

<p>"Jack!" said Colonel Tempest.</p>

<p>Mr. Tempest heard from an immense
distance, and came painfully back across
long wastes and desert places of confused
memories, came slowly back to the room,
and the dim sunshine, and himself; and<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
stopped short with a jarred sense as he
saw his own long feeble hands laid upon
the counterpane. He had forgotten them,
though he recognized them now he saw
them again. Why had he returned?</p>

<p>"Jack," said the voice again.</p>

<p>Mr. Tempest opened his eyes suddenly,
and looked full at his brother&mdash;at the false,
weak, handsome face of the man who had
injured him.</p>

<p>It all came back, the passion and the
despair; the intolerable agony of jealousy
and baffled love; and the deadly, deadly
hatred. Fourteen years ago was it since
Diana had been taken from him? It returned
upon him as though it were yesterday. A
light flamed up in the dying eyes before
which Colonel Tempest quailed.</p>

<p>All the sentences he had prepared beforehand
seemed to fail him, as prepared sentences
have a way of doing, being made to<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
fit imaginary circumstances, and being consequently
unsuited to any others. Mr.
Tempest, who had not prepared anything,
had the advantage.</p>

<p>"Curse you," he said, in his low, difficult
whisper. "You damned scoundrel!"</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest was shocked. To bear
a grudge after all these years! Jack had
always been vindictive! And what an unchristian
state of mind for one on the brink
of that nightmare of horror, the grave! He
was unable to articulate.</p>

<p>"What are you here for?" said Mr.
Tempest, after a pause. "Who let you in?
Why can't I be allowed to die in peace?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk like that, Jack!" gasped
Colonel Tempest, speaking extempore, after
fumbling in all the empty pockets of his
mind for something appropriate to say. "I
am sure I am very sorry for&mdash;&mdash;" A look
warned him that even his tactful reference<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
to a certain subject would be resented.
"But, it's all past and gone now, and&mdash;it's
a long time ago, and you're&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dying," suggested Mr. Tempest.</p>

<p>"... and," hurried on Colonel Tempest,
glad of the lift, "it's not for my own sake
I've come. But I've got a boy, Jack; he is
here now. I have brought him with me.
Such a fine, handsome boy&mdash;every inch a
Tempest, and the image of our father. I
don't want to speak for myself, but for the
sake of the boy, and the place, and the old
name."</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest hid his quivering face in
his hands. He was really moved.</p>

<p>The sick man's mouth twitched; he
evidently understood his brother's incoherent
words.</p>

<p>"John succeeds," he said.</p>

<p>The two men looked away from each other.</p>

<p>"John is not a Tempest," said Colonel<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
Tempest, in a choked voice. "You know
it&mdash;everybody knows it!"</p>

<p>"He was born in wedlock."</p>

<p>"Yes; but he is not your son. You
would have divorced her if she had lived.
He is the legal heir, of course, if you countenance
him; but something might be done
still&mdash;it is not too late. I know the estate
goes, failing you and your children, to me
and mine. Don't bear a grudge, Jack. You
can't have any feeling for the child&mdash;it's
against nature. Remember the old name
and the old place, that has never been out of
the hands of a Tempest yet. Don't drag
our honour in the dust and put it to open
shame! Think how it would have grieved
our father. Let me call in the doctor and
the nurse, and disown him now before witnesses.
Such things have been done before,
and may be again. I can contest his claim
then; I shall have something to go on. And<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
you <i>must</i> have proofs of his illegitimacy if
you will only give them. But there will be
<i>no</i> chance if you uphold him to the last, and
if&mdash;and if you&mdash;die&mdash;without speaking."</p>

<p>Mr. Tempest made no answer except to
look his brother steadily in the face. The
look was sufficient. It said plainly enough,
"That is what I mean to do."</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest lost all hope, but despair
made one final clutch&mdash;a last desperate appeal
to his brother's feelings. It is one of the
misfortunes of self-centred people that their
otherwise convenient habit of disregarding
what is passing in the minds of others, leads
them to trample on their feelings at the very
moment when most desirous of turning them
to their own account. Colonel Tempest,
with the best intentions of a pure self-interest,
trampled heavily.</p>

<p>"Pass me over&mdash;cut me out," he said,
with a vague inappreciation of points of law.<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
"I'll sign anything you please; but let the
little chap have it&mdash;let Archie have it&mdash;<i>Di's
son</i>."</p>

<p>There was a silence that might be felt.
Approaching death seemed to make a stride
in those few breathless seconds; but it seemed
also as if a determined will were holding him
momentarily at arm's length. Mr. Tempest
turned his fading face towards his brother.
His eyes were unflinching, but his voice was
almost inaudible.</p>

<p>"Leave me," he said. "John succeeds."</p>

<p>The blood rushed to Colonel Tempest's
head, and then seemed to ebb away from his
heart. A sudden horror took him of some
subtle change that was going forward in the
room, and, seeing all was lost, he hastily
left it.</p>

<p>The two boys had fraternized meanwhile.
Each, it appeared, was collecting coins, and
Archie gave a glowing account of the cabinet<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
his father had given him to put them in.
John kept his in an old sock, which he
solemnly produced, and the time was happily
passed in licking the most important coins,
to give them a momentary brightness, and
in comparing notes upon them. John was
sorry when Colonel Tempest came hurriedly
down the gallery and carried Archie off
before he had time to say good-bye, or to
offer him his best coin, which he had hot in
his hand with a view to presentation.</p>

<p>Before he had time to gather up his collection,
the old doctor came to him, and told
him, very gravely and kindly, that his father
wished to see him.</p>

<p>John nodded, and put down the sock at
once. He was a person of few words, and,
though he longed to ask a question now, he
asked it with his eyes only. John's deep-set
eyes were very dark and melancholy. Could
it be that his mother's remorse had left its<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
trace in the young unconscious eyes of her
child? Their beauty somewhat redeemed
the square ugliness of the rest of his face.</p>

<p>The doctor patted him on the head, and
led him gently to Mr. Tempest's door.</p>

<p>"Go in and speak to him," he said. "Do
not be afraid. I shall be in the next room
all the time."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," said John, drawing
himself up, and he went quietly across the
great oak-panelled room and stood at the
bedside.</p>

<p>There was a look of tension in Mr. Tempest's
face and hands, as if he were holding
on tightly to something which, did he once
let go, he would never be able to regain.</p>

<p>"John," he said, in an acute whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes, father." The child's face was pale
and his eyes looked awed, but they met
Mr. Tempest's bravely.</p>

<p>"Try and listen to what I am going to<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
say, and remember it. You are a very little
boy now, but you will hold a great position
some day&mdash;when you are a man. You will
be the head of the family. Tempest is one
of the oldest names in England. Remember
what I say"&mdash;the whisper seemed to break
and ravel down under the intense strain put
on it to a single quivering strand&mdash;"remember&mdash;you
will understand it when you are older.
It is a great trust put into your hands.
When you grow into a man, much will be
expected of you. Never disgrace your
name; it stands high. Keep it up&mdash;keep it
up." The whisper seemed to die altogether,
but an iron will forced it momentarily back
to the grey toiling lips. "You are the head
of the family; do your duty by it. You will
have no one much to help you. I shall not&mdash;be
there. You must learn to be an upright,
honourable gentleman by yourself.
Do you understand?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>"And you will&mdash;<i>remember</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father." If the lip quivered, the
answer came nevertheless.</p>

<p>"That is all; you can go."</p>

<p>The child hesitated.</p>

<p>"Good night," he said gravely, advancing
a step nearer. The sun was still streaming
across the room, but it seemed to him, as
he looked at the familiar, unfamiliar face,
that it was night already.</p>

<p>"Don't kiss me," said the dying man.
"Good night."</p>

<p>And the child went.</p>

<p>Mr. Tempest sighed heavily, and relaxed
his hold on the consciousness that was ready
to slip away from him, and wander feebly
out he knew not whither. Hours and voices
came and went. His own voice had gone
down into silence before him. It was still
broad daylight, but the casement was slowly<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
growing "a glimmering square," and he
observed it.</p>

<p>Presently it flickered&mdash;glimmered&mdash;and
went out.</p>

<span class="hide">I</span>T was a sultry night in June rather
more than a year after Mr. Tempest's
death. An action had been brought by
Colonel Tempest directly after his brother's
death, when the will was proved in which
Mr. Tempest bequeathed everything in his
power to bequeath to his "son John." The
action failed; no one except Colonel<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
Tempest had ever been sanguine that it
would succeed. Colonel Tempest was
unable to support an assertion of which few
did not recognize the probable truth. No
proof of John's suspected illegitimacy was
forthcoming. His mother had died when
he was born; it was eleven years ago. The
fact that Mr. Tempest had mentioned him
by name as his son in his will was overwhelming
evidence to the contrary. The
long-delayed blow fell at last. A verdict
was given in favour of the little schoolboy.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for you, I am, indeed," said
Mr. Swayne, composedly watching Colonel
Tempest flinging himself about his little
room, into which the latter had just rushed,
nearly beside himself at the decision of a
bribed and perjured court.</p>

<p>Mr. Swayne was a stout, florid-looking
man between forty and fifty, with a heavy
face like a grimace that some one else had<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
made, who laboured under the delusion, unshared
by any of his fellow-creatures, that
he was a gentleman. In what class he had
been born no one knew. What he was now
any one could see for himself. He was
generally considered by the men with whom
he associated a good fellow for an ally in a
disreputable pinch, and a blackguard when
the pinch was over. Every one regarded
Dandy Swayne with contempt, but for all
that "The Snowdrop," as he was playfully
called, might be seen in the chambers and
at the dinners of men far above him in the
social scale, who probably for very good
reasons tolerated his presence, and for even
better reviled him behind his back. He had
a certain shrewdness and knowledge of the
seamy side of human nature which stood
him in good stead. He was a noted billiard
player&mdash;a little too noted, perhaps. His
short, thick ringed hands did not mind much<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
what they fastened on. He was not troubled
by conscientious scruples. The charm of
Dandy Swayne's character was that he stuck
at nothing. He would go down any sewer
provided there was money in it, and money
there always was somewhere in everything
he took in hand. Dandy Swayne's career
had had strange ups and downs. No one
knew how he lived. The private fortune
on which he was wont to enlarge of course
existed only in his own imagination. Sometimes
he disappeared entirely for longer or
shorter periods&mdash;generally after money
transactions of a nature that required
privacy and foreign travel. But the same
Providence which tempers the wind to the
shorn lamb watches over the shearer also,
and he always reappeared again, sooner or
later, with his creased white waistcoat and
yesterday's gardenia, and the old swagger
that endeared him to his fellow-creatures.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[56]</span></p>

<p>He was up in the world just now, living
"in style" in smart chambers strewn with
photographs of actresses, and littered with
cheap expensive furniture, and plush hangings
redolent of smoke and stale scent,
among which Colonel Tempest was knocking
about in his disordered evening dress.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for you, Colonel," repeated
Mr. Swayne, slowly; "but I wish to &mdash;&mdash;
you'd sit down and not rush up and down
like that. It's not a bit of good taking on
in that way, though it's &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; luck all
the same."</p>

<p>Mr. Swayne's conversation was devoid of
that severe simplicity which society demands;
indeed, it was so encrusted and enriched
with ornamental gems of expression of a
surprising and dubious character, that to
present his conversation to the reader without
the personal peculiarities of his choice of
language is to do him an injustice which,<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
however unavoidable, is much to be regretted.
Mr. Swayne's conversation without his oaths
might be compared to a bird without its
feathers; the body is there, but all individuality
and beauty of contour is gone.</p>

<p>Mr. Swayne filled his glass, and pushed
the bottle across to his friend, whose flushed
face and shaking hand showed that he had
had enough already. Colonel Tempest sat
down impatiently and filled his glass, too.</p>

<p>"It's the will that did it, I suppose,"
suggested Mr. Swayne; "that tipped it
over."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Colonel Tempest, striking his
clenched hand on the table. "<i>My son John</i>
he called him in his will; there was no
getting over that. He knew it when he put
those words in. He knew I should contest
the succession, and he hated me so that he
perjured himself to keep me out of my own,
and stuck to it even on his death-bed. John<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
is no more his son than you are. A little
dark Fane, that is what he is. They say he
takes after his mother's family; he well may
do, &mdash;&mdash; him!"</p>

<p>Mr. Swayne sympathetically echoed the
sentiment in a varied but not less forcible
form of speech.</p>

<p>"And my son," continued Colonel Tempest,
his fair weak face whitening with
passion&mdash;"you know my boy; look at him&mdash;a
Tempest to the backbone, down to his
finger-nails. You can't look at him among
the pictures in the gallery and not see he is
bone of their bone and flesh of their flesh.
He is as like the Vandyke of Amyas
Tempest the cavalier as he can be. It
drives me mad to think of him, cut out by
a bastard!"</p>

<p>Mr. Swayne appeared to be in a meditative
turn of mind. He watched the smoke
of his cigar curl upwards from the unshaved
crater of his lip into the air.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<p>"You're in the tail, I suppose?" he remarked
at last.</p>

<p>"Of course I am. If my brother John
died without children, everything was to
come to me and my heirs. My brother had
only a life interest in the place."</p>

<p>"Then I don't see how he was to blame,
doing as he did, if it was entailed all along
on his son." Mr. Swayne spoke with a
certain cautious interest.</p>

<p>"He never <i>had</i> a son. If he had disowned
his wife's child, everything would
have come to me."</p>

<p>"Lor!" said Mr. Swayne, "I did not
understand it was so near as that. Then
this little chap, this John, he's all that
stands between you and the property, is he?
Failing him, it still comes to you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Swayne's small tightly-wedged eyes,
with the expression of dissipated boot-buttons,
were beginning to show a gleam of
professional interest.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, it would; but John won't fail," said
Colonel Tempest, savagely. "He will keep
us out. We shall be as poor as rats as long
as we live, and shall see him chucking our
money right and left!" and Colonel Tempest,
who was by this time hardly responsible
for what he said, ground his teeth and cursed
his enemy in a paroxysm of rage and drink.
Mr. Swayne observed him attentively.</p>

<p>"Don't take on so, Colonel," he remarked
soothingly. "Dear me, what's a little
boy?&mdash;What's a little boy here or there," he
continued, meditatively, "one more or one
less? There's a sight of little kids in the
world; some wanted, some not. I've known
cases, Colonel"&mdash;here he fixed his eyes on
the ceiling&mdash;"cases with parents, maybe,
singing up in heaven and takin' no notice,
when little chaps that weren't wanted, that
nobody took to, seemed to&mdash;meet with an
accident, get snuffed out by mistake."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>

<p>"John won't meet with an accident," said
Colonel Tempest passionately. "I wish to &mdash;&mdash; he would!"</p>

<p>"I look at it this way," said Mr. Swayne,
philosophically. "There's things gentlemen
can do, and there's things they can't. A
gentleman is a party that can't do his dirty
work for himself, though as often as not he
has a deal on his hands that must be shoved
through somehow. The thing is to find
parties who'll take what I call a personal
interest, if it's made worth their while. Now
about this little boy, that no one wants, and is
a comfort to nobody. It's quite curious the
things little boys will do; out in boats alone,
outriggers now, as dangerous as can be, or
leaning out of railway carriages in tunnels.
Lor! you never know what they won't be
up to, little rascals. They're made of mischief.
Forty thousand a year, is it, he is
keeping you out of, and yours by right?<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
Well, I don't say anything about that; but
all I say is, I have friends I can find that
are open to a bet. What's the harm of betting
a thousand pounds to one sovereign
that you never come into the property? It
ain't likely, as you say. What's the harm of
a bet, provided you don't mind risking your
money? Let's say, just for the sake of&mdash;of
argument, that there <i>was</i> ten bets&mdash;ten bets
at a thousand to one that you never come in.
Ten thousand pounds to pay, if you come
in after all. What's ten thousand pounds to
a man with forty thousand a year?" Mr.
Swayne snapped his fingers. "And no
trouble to nobody. Nothing to do but to
pay up quietly when the time comes. It
don't concern you who takes up the bets,
and you don't know either. You know
nothing at all about it. You lay your money,
and, look here, Colonel, you mark my words,
some way or somehow, some time or other,
<i>that boy will disappear</i>."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[63]</span></p>

<p>The two men looked steadily at each
other. Colonel Tempest's eyes were bloodshot,
but Mr. Swayne had all his wits about
him; he never became intoxicated, even at
the expense of others, if there was money in
keeping sober.</p>

<p>"Curse him!" said Colonel Tempest in a
hoarse whisper. "He should not get in my
light."</p>

<p>The child was to blame, naturally.</p>

<p>Mr. Swayne did not answer, but went to a
side table, on which were pens, ink, and
paper. Some things, if done at all, are best
done quickly.</p>

<span class="hide">F</span>IFTEEN years is a long time. What
companies of trite reflections crowd
the mind as it looks back across the marshes
and the fens, and the highlands and the
lowlands, and the weary desert places, to
some point that catches the eye in the
middle distance! We stood there once.
Perhaps we go back in memory&mdash;all the
way back&mdash;to that little town and spire in
the green country, and pray once again in
the cool vision-haunted church, and peer up
once again at the window in the narrow<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
street where Love lived and looked out,
where patience and affection dwell together
now. They were always friends, those two.</p>

<p>Or perhaps we look back to a parting of
the ways which did not seem to be a parting
at the time, and recall a "Good-bye" that
was lightly uttered because it was only
thought to be <i>Au revoir</i>. We see now,
from where we stand, the point where the
paths diverged.</p>

<p>Fifteen years!</p>

<p>They have not passed very smoothly over
the head of Colonel Tempest. Whenever
he looked back across the breezy uplands of
his well-spent life, his eye avoided and yet
was inevitably attracted with a loathing
allurement to one dark spot in the middle
distance, where&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago or yesterday was it?</p>

<p>The old nightmare, with the shuddering
horror of yesterday mingled with the heavy<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
pressure of years, might come back at any
moment&mdash;was always coming back.</p>

<p>That sultry night in June!</p>

<p>Everything was disjointed and fragmentary
in his memory the morning after it; he
could not see the whole. He had a confused
recollection of an intense passionate hatred
that was like a physical pain, and of Swayne's
voice saying, "What's a little boy?" And
then there were slips of paper. Swayne said
a bet was a bet. He, Colonel Tempest, had
had something to do with those slips of
paper&mdash;<i>What?</i>&mdash;One had fallen on the floor,
and Swayne had blotted it carefully. There
was Swayne's voice again, "Your handwriting
ain't up to much, Colonel." He
had written something then. What was it?
His own name? Memory failed. Who
was that devil in the room, with Swayne's
face and blurred watch-chain&mdash;two watch-chains&mdash;and
the thick busy hands? And<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
then it was night, and he was in the streets
again in the hot darkness, among the blinking
lamps and stars that looked like eyes,
and Swayne was seeing him home. And
there was a horror over everything; horror
leant over him at night, horror woke him
in the morning and pursued him throughout
the day, and the next day, and the
next. What had he done? He tried to
piece together the broken fragments that
his groping memory could glean; but
nothing came of it&mdash;at least, nothing he
could believe. But Swayne knew. On the
third day he could bear it no longer, and he
went to find him; but Swayne had disappeared.
Colonel Tempest went up to his
chambers on the pretence of a letter&mdash;of
something; he knew not what. They were
swept and garnished in readiness for new
arrivals, for if one choice spirit disappears,
a good landlady knows what to expect.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>Colonel Tempest looked once round the
room, and then sat feebly down. It was as
if for days he had been staring at a blank
sheet, and now a dark slide had been
suddenly taken from the magic lantern.
The picture was before him in all its tawdry
distinctness. <i>He knew what he had done.</i></p>

<p>Colonel Tempest was not a radically bad
man. Who is? But there was in him a
kind of weakness of fibre which consists
in being subservient to the impulse of the
moment. The effects of a feeble yielding
to impulse are sometimes hardly to be distinguished
from those of the most deliberate
and thorough-paced sin.</p>

<p>He was conscious of good in himself, of
a refined dislike to coarseness and vice even
when he dabbled in it, of vague longings
after better things, of amiable, even chivalrous,
inclinations towards others, especially
towards women not of his own family. In<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
his own family, where there had always
been, even in his mother's time, some feminine
weakness or imperfection for a manly
nature to point out and ridicule, of course
courtesy and tenderness could not be expected
of him.</p>

<p>Thus at each juncture of his life he was
obliged to justify what he would have called
his failings, what some would have called
sins, by laying the blame on others, and by
this means to account for the glaring discrepancy
between the inward and spiritual
gracefulness of his feelings and the outward
and visible signs of his actions.</p>

<p>A man with such good impulses, such an
affectionate nature, cannot be a sinner. If
there was one thing more than another that
Colonel Tempest thoroughly believed in, it
was in his affectionate nature. He might
have his faults, he was wont to say, but his
heart was in the right place. If things went<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
amiss, the fault was in the circumstance, in
the temptation, in the unfortunate character
of those with whom his life was knit. Weakness
has its superstition, and superstition its
scapegoat. His father had spoilt him. His
wife had not understood him. His brother
had played him false. Swayne had tempted
him.</p>

<p>What have not those to answer for who
teach us in language, however spiritual, however
orthodox, to lay our sins on others&mdash;on
<i>any other</i> except ourselves!</p>

<p>After the first shock of panic, of terror
lest he had done something for which he
might eventually have to suffer, Colonel
Tempest struggled back to the well-worn
position, now clutched with both hands, that
he had been betrayed in a moment of passion
by a fiend in human shape, and that, if&mdash;anything
happened, Swayne was the most
to blame.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>Still they were dreadful days at first&mdash;dreadful
weeks in which he suffered for
Swayne's sin. And Swayne seemed to have
disappeared for good&mdash;or perhaps for evil.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;gradually&mdash;inasmuch as nothing
had power to affect him for long
together, the horror lightened.</p>

<p>The sun rose and set. The world went on.
A year passed. Archie wrote for money
from school. Things took their usual course.
Colonel Tempest had his hair cut as usual;
he observed with keen regret that it was
thinning at the top. Life settled back into
its old groove.</p>

<p><i>Nothing happened.</i></p>

<p>To persons gifted with imagination, what
is more solemn, or more appalling, than the
pause which follows on any decisive action
which is perceived to have within it the seed
of a result&mdash;a result which even now is
germinating in darkness, is growing towards<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
the light, foreseen, but unknown? With
what body will they come, we ask ourselves&mdash;these
slow results that spring from the
dust of our spent actions? Faith sows and
waits. Sin sows and trembles. The fool
sows and forgets. Colonel Tempest was
practically an Atheist. He did not believe
in cause and effect; he believed in chance.
He had sown, but perhaps nothing would
come up. He had seen the lightning, but
perhaps the thunder might not follow
after all.</p>

<p>Suddenly, one winter morning, without
warning, it growled on the horizon.</p>

<p>"That inconvenient little nephew of yours
has precious nearly hooked it," said a man
in the club to him as he came in. "His
tutor must be a plucky chap. I should owe
him a grudge if I were you."</p>

<p>The man held out the paper to him, and,
turning away with a laugh, went out whistling.<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
He meant no harm; but the smallest
arrow of a refined pleasantry can prick if it
happens to come between the joints of the
harness.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest felt sea-sick. The room
was empty except for the waiter, who was
arranging his breakfast on one of the
tables by the window. The fire leapt
and blazed; everything swayed. He sat
down mechanically in his accustomed place,
still clutching the paper. He tried to
read it, to find the place, but he could
see nothing. At last he poured out a
cup of coffee and drank it, and then tried
again. There it was: Narrow escape of
Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Tempest on the
Metropolitan Railway. Mr. Goodwin and
his charge, Mr. Tempest, were returning by
the last train from the Crystal Palace.
Tremendous crowd on the platform. Struggle
for the train as it came in. Mr. Tempest<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
pushed down between the still moving train
and the platform. Heroic devotion of Mr.
Goodwin. Rescue of Mr. Tempest uninjured.
Serious injuries of Mr. Goodwin.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest read no more. He
wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>Swayne's men were at their devil's work,
then! Perhaps they had tried before and
failed, and he had not heard of it? They
would try again&mdash;presently. Perhaps next
time they would succeed.</p>

<p>The old horror woke up again with an
acuteness that for the moment seemed
greater than he could bear. Weak men
should abstain from wrong-doing. They
cannot stand the brunt of their own actions;
the kick of the gun is too much for them.</p>

<p>And from that time to this the horror
never wholly left him; if it slumbered, it
was only to reawaken. At long intervals
incidents happened, sometimes of the most<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
trifling description, and some of which he
did not even hear of at the time, which
roused it afresh. There seemed to be a
fate against John at Eton which followed
him to Oxford. Archie, who was at Eton
and Oxford with him, occasionally let things
drop by chance which made Colonel Tempest's
blood run cold.</p>

<p>"They have failed so far," he would say to
himself; "but they will do it yet. I know
they will do it in the end!"</p>

<p>At last he made a desperate attempt to
find Swayne, and cancel the bet; but perhaps
Swayne knew the man he had to deal
with, and had foreseen a movement of that
kind. At any rate, he was not to be discovered.
Colonel Tempest found himself
helpless.</p>

<p>Was there no anodyne for this recurring
agony? He dared not drown it in drink.
What might he not say under its influence?<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
The consolations of religion, or rather of the
Church, which he had always understood to
be a sort of mental chloroform for uneasy
consciences, did not seem to meet his case.
The thought of John's danger never troubled
him&mdash;John's possible death. The superstitious
terror was for himself alone. He
wanted a religion which would adhere to him
of its own accord, and be in the way when
needed; and he tried various kinds recommended
for the purpose, but&mdash;without effect.</p>

<p>Perhaps a religion for self-centred people
remains to be invented. Even religiosity
(the patent medicine of the spiritual life of
the age&mdash;the universal pain-killer)&mdash;even religiosity,
though it meets almost all requirements,
does not quite fill that gap.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest became subject to long
attacks of nervous irritation and depression.
He ceased to be a good, and consequently
a popular, companion. His health, never<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
strong, always abused, began to waver. At
fifty-five he looked thin and aged. He had
come before his time to the evil days and
the years which have no pleasure in
them.</p>

<p>As he turned out of St. George's Church,
Hanover Square, on this particular spring
afternoon, whither he had gone to assist at
a certain fashionable wedding at which his
daughter Diana had officiated as bridesmaid,
he looked broken down and feeble beyond
his years.</p>

<p>A broad-shouldered, dark man elbowed
his way through the throng of footmen and
spectators, and came up with him.</p>

<p>"Are not you going back to the house?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Colonel Tempest&mdash;"I hate
weddings! I hate the whole thing. I only
went to have a look at my child, who was
bridesmaid. Di is my only daughter, but I<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
don't see much of her; others take care of
that." His tone was pathetic. He had
gradually come to believe that his child had
been wrested from him by Mrs. Courtenay,
and that he was a defrauded parent.</p>

<p>"I am not going to the house, either,"
said John Tempest, for it was he. "I don't
hate weddings, but I detest that one. Do
you mind coming down to my club? I have
not seen you really to speak to since I came
back. I want to have a talk with you about
Archie; he seems to have been improving
the shining hours during these three years
I have been away."</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest winced jealously. He
knew John had paid the considerable debts
that Archie had contrived to amass, not
only during the short time he was at
Oxford, before he left to cram for the
army, but also at Sandhurst. But Colonel
Tempest had felt no gratitude on that score.<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
Was not all John's wealth Archie's by right?
and John must know it. Men do not grow
up in ignorance of such a fact as a slur on
their parentage. What was a dole of a few
hundred pounds now and again, when a man
was wrongfully keeping possession of many
thousands?</p>

<p>"Young men are all alike," said Colonel
Tempest, testily. "Archie is no worse than
the rest. Poor fellow, it's very little I can
do for him! It's deuced expensive living in
the Guards; I found it so myself."</p>

<p>John might have asked, except that these
are precisely the questions that make enmity
between relations, why Colonel Tempest
had put him in the Guards, considering that
it was an idle life, and Archie was absolutely
without expectations of any description. He
and his sister Di had not even the modest
fortune of a younger son eventually to
divide between them. One of the beauties<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
of Colonel Tempest's romantic clandestine
marriage had been the lack of settlements,
which, though it had prevented his wife
bringing him anything owing to the rupture
with her family, had at any rate enabled him
to whittle away his own private fortune at
will, and to inveigh at the same time against
the miserliness of the Courtenays, who
ought, of course, to have provided for his
children.</p>

<p>How Colonel Tempest kept going at all
no one knew. How Archie was kept going
most people knew, or rather guessed without
difficulty. John and Archie had held firmly
together at Eton, and afterwards at Oxford.
John had untied a very uncomfortable knot
that had arranged itself round the innocent
Archibald at Sandhurst. It could hardly be
said that there was friendship between the
two, but John, though only one year his
cousin's senior, had taken the position of<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
elder brother from the first, and had stood
by Archie on occasions when that choice,
but expensive, spirit needed a good deal of
standing by. Archie had inherited other
things from his father besides his perfect
profile, and knew as well as most men which
side his bread was buttered. They were
friends in the ordinary acceptance of that
misused term. John had just returned from
three years' absence at the Russian and
Austrian Courts, and Archie, who had begun
to feel his absence irksome in the extreme,
had welcomed him back with effusion.</p>

<p>"Come into the Carlton and let us talk
things over," said John.</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Colonel Tempest
occasionally almost liked John, even while he
kicked against the pricks of a certain respect
which he could not entirely smother for this
grave quiet man of few words. When he
was not for the moment jealous of him&mdash;and<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
there were such moments&mdash;he could afford to
indulge a sentiment almost of regret for him.
At times he still hated him with the perfect
hatred of the injurer for the injured; but
nothing to stir that latent superstitious horror,
and consequent detestation of the cause of
the horror, had occurred of late years. They
had walked slowly down Bond Street and
St. James's Street, and had reached the
Carlton. Close by the steps a man was
lounging. Colonel Tempest saw him look
attentively at John as they came up, and the
blood left his heart. It was Swayne.</p>

<p>In a moment the horror was awake again&mdash;wide
awake, hydra-headed, close at hand,
insupportable.</p>

<p>Swayne stared for a moment full at
Colonel Tempest, and then turned away and
sauntered slowly along Pall Mall.</p>

<p>"Won't you come in?" said John, as his
companion hesitated.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<p>"Not to-day. Another time," said Colonel
Tempest, and incoherently making he knew
not what excuse, he left John to join another
man who was entering at that moment, and
hurried after Swayne. He overtook him as
he passed through the gates into St. James's
Park. It was a dull, foggy afternoon, and
there were not many people about.</p>

<p>Swayne nodded carelessly to him as he
joined him. He evidently did not mind
being overtaken.</p>

<p>"Well, Colonel," he said, in the half
insolent manner that in men like Swayne
implies a knowledge that they have got the
whip hand. Swayne was not to be outshone
in the art of grovelling by any of his own
species of fellow-worm, but he did not grovel
unnecessarily. His higher nature was that
of a bully.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash; you, Swayne, where have you been
all these years?" said Colonel Tempest,<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
hurriedly. "I've tried to find you over and
over again."</p>

<p>"I've been busy, Colonel," returned Mr.
Swayne, swaying himself on tight light-checked
legs, and pushing back his grey high
hat. "Business before pleasure. That's my
motto. And I've been mortal sick, too.
Thought I should have gone up this time last
year. I did indeed. You look the worse for
wear too; but I must not be standing talking
here, pleasant as it is to meet old friends."</p>

<p>"Look here, Swayne," said Colonel Tempest,
in great agitation, laying a spasmodic
clutch on Swayne's arm, "I can't stand it
any longer. I can't indeed. It's wearing
me into my grave. I want you&mdash;to cancel
the bet. You must cancel it. I won't bear
it. If you won't cancel it, I won't pay up
when the&mdash;if the time comes."</p>

<p>"Won't you?" said Swayne, with contempt.
"I know better."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[85]</span></p>

<p>"I must get out of it. It's killing me,"
repeated Colonel Tempest, ignoring Swayne's
last remark.</p>

<p>"Pay up, then," said Swayne. "If you
won't bear it, pay up."</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest was staggered.</p>

<p>"I have not a thousand pounds I could
lay my hands on," he said hoarsely, "much
less ten. I've been broke these last five
years. You know that."</p>

<p>"Raise it," said Swayne. "I ain't against
that; quite the reverse. There's been a deal
of time and money wasted already. All the
parties will be glad to have the money down.
He's in England again now, thank the
Lord. That's a saving of expense. I was
waiting to have a look at him myself when
you came up. I've never set eyes on him
before."</p>

<p>"I can't raise it," said Colonel Tempest
with the despairing remembrance of repeated<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
failures in that direction. "I can't give
security for five hundred."</p>

<p>"If you can't pay it, and you can't raise
it," said Swayne, shaking off Colonel Tempest's
hand, and thrusting his own into his
pockets, "what's the good of talking? Sorry
not to part friends, Colonel; but what's done
is done. You can't send back shoes to the
maker that have come to pinch on wearing
'em. You should have thought of that before.
Business is business, and a bet's a bet."</p>

<span class="hide">R</span>OOMS seldom represent their inmates
faithfully, any more than photographs
their originals, and a poorly-furnished room,
like a bad photograph, is, as a rule, a caricature.
But there are fortunate persons who
can weave for themselves out of apparently
incongruous odds and ends of <i>bric-&agrave;-brac</i>, and
china, and cretonne, a habitation which is as
peculiar to them as the moss cocoon is to
the long-tailed tit, or as the spillikins, in
which she coldly cherishes the domestic
affections, are to the water-hen.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>Madeleine Thesinger's little boudoir looking
over Park Lane was as like her as a
translation is to the original. Madeleine was
one of the many young souls who mistake
eccentricity for originality. It was therefore
to be expected that a life-sized china monkey
should be suspended from the ceiling by a
gilt chain, not even holding a lamp as an
excuse for its presence. Her artistic tendencies
required that scarlet pampas grass
should stand in a high yellow jar on the
piano, and that the piano itself should be
festooned with terra-cotta Liberty silk. A
little palm near had its one slender leg draped
in an <i>impromptu</i> Turkish trouser, made out of
an amber handkerchief. Even the flowers
are leaving their garden of Eden now. They
require clothing, just as chrysanthemums
must have their hair curled. We shall put
the lily into corsets next!</p>

<p>There was a faint scent of incense in the<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
room. A low couch, covered with striped
Oriental rugs and cushions, was drawn near
the fire. Beside it was a small carved table&mdash;everything
was small&mdash;with a few devotional
books upon it, an open Bible, and a
hyacinth in water. A frame, on which some
elaborate Church embroidery was stretched,
kept the Bible in countenance. The walls
were draped as only young ladies, defiant of
all laws of taste or common sense, but determined
on originality, can drape them. The
<i>porti&egrave;re</i> alone fell all its length to the ground.
The other curtains were caught up or
tweaked across, or furled like flags against
the walls above chromos and engravings,
over which it was quite unnecessary that
they should ever be lowered. The pictures
themselves were mostly sentimental or religious.
Leighton's "Wedded" hung as a
pendant to "The Light of the World." The
small room was crowded with tiny ornaments<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
and brittle conceits, and mirrors placed
at convenient angles. There was no room
to put anything down anywhere.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Verelst, when he was ushered
in, large and stout and expectant, instantly
knocked over a white china mandarin whose
tongue dropped out on the carpet as he
picked it up. He replaced it with awe,
tongue and all, and then, taking refuge on
the hearth-rug, promenaded his pale prawn-like
eyes round the apartment to see where
he could put down his hat. But apparently
there was no vacant place, for he continued
to clutch it in a tightly-gloved hand, and to
stare absently in front of him, sniffing the
unmodulated sniff of solitary nervousness.</p>

<p>Sir Henry had a vacant face. The only
change of which it was capable was a change
of colour. Under the influence of great
emotion he could become very red, instead
of red, but that was all. He was a stout<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
man, and his feelings never got as far as
the surface; they probably gave up the
attempt half way. He was feeling a great
deal&mdash;for him&mdash;at this moment, but his face
was as stolid as a doll's. He had fallen
suddenly and desperately in love, bald head
over red ears in love, with Madeleine, after
his own fashion, since she had shown him
so decidedly that he was dear to her on
that evening a fortnight ago when he had
hovered round her in his usual "fancy free"
and easy manner, merely because she was
the prettiest girl in the room. He now
thought her the most wonderful and beautiful
and religious person in the world. He
had been counting the hours till he should
see her again. He did not know how to
bear being kept waiting in this way; but he
did not turn a hair, possibly because there
were not many to turn. He stood as if he
were stuffed. At last, after a long interval,<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
there was a step in the passage. He sighed
copiously through his nose, and changed
legs; his dull eyes turned to the <i>porti&egrave;re</i>.</p>

<p>A French maid entered, who in broken
English explained that mademoiselle could
not see monsieur. Mademoiselle had a
headache. Would monsieur call again at
five o'clock?</p>

<p>Sir Henry started, and became his reddest,
face, and ears, and neck; but, after a momentary
pause, he merely nodded to the
woman and went out, knocking over the
same china figure from the same table as he
did so, but this time without perceiving it.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone, the maid replaced
the piece of china now permanently
tongueless, and then raised her eyes and
hands.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" she said below her breath,
as she left the room. "Quel fianc&eacute;!"</p>

<p>A few moments later Madeleine came in<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
her headache appeared to be sufficiently
relieved to allow of her coming down now
that her betrothed had departed. She pulled
down the rose-coloured blinds, and then
flung herself with a little shiver on to the
couch beside the fire. She was very pretty,
very fair, very small, very feminine in dress
and manner. That she was seven and
twenty it would have been impossible to
believe, except by daylight, but for a certain
tinge of laboured youthfulness in her demeanour.</p>

<p>She put up two of the dearest little hands
to her small curled head, and then held them
to the fire with a gesture of annoyance.
Her eyes&mdash;they were pretty appealing eyes,
with delicately-bistred eyelashes&mdash;fell upon
her diamond engagement-ring as she did so,
and she turned her left hand from side to
side to make the stones catch the light.</p>

<p>She was still looking at her ring when the<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
door opened, and "Miss Tempest" was
announced.</p>

<p>"Well, Madeleine?" said a fresh clear
voice.</p>

<p>"<i>Dear</i> Di!" said Madeleine, rising and
throwing herself into her friend's arms.
"How good of you to come, and so early,
too! I have been so longing to see you,
so longing to tell you about everything!"
She drew her visitor down beside her on
the couch, and took possession of her hand.</p>

<p>"I am very anxious to hear," said Di,
disengaging her hand after a moment, and
pulling off her furred gloves and boa.</p>

<p>"Let me help you, you dear thing," said
Madeleine, unfastening her friend's coat, in
which action the engagement-ring took a
good deal of exercise. "Is it very cold out?
What a colour you have! I never saw you
looking so well."</p>

<p>"Really?" said Di, remembering how<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
Madeleine had made the same remark on
her return last year from fishing in Scotland
with her face burnt brick red. "One does
not generally look one's best after being out
in a wind like a knife; but I am glad you
think so. And now tell me all about <i>it</i>."</p>

<p>Di's long, rather large, white hand was
taken into both Madeleine's small ones
again, and fondled in silence for a few
moments.</p>

<p>Di looked at her with an expression half
puzzled, half benevolent, as a Newfoundland
might look at a toy terrier. She was in
reality five or six years younger than Madeleine,
but her height and a certain natural
dignity of carriage and manner gave her the
appearance of being much older&mdash;by a rose-coloured
light.</p>

<p>"It was very sudden," said Madeleine
in a shy whisper, evidently enjoying the
situation.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>"How sudden? Do you mean it was a
sudden idea on his part?"</p>

<p>"No, you tiresome thing, of course not;
but it came upon <i>me</i> very suddenly."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>After all a bite may with truth be called
sudden by the angler who has long and
persistently cast over that and every other
rise within reach.</p>

<p>"You see," said Madeline, "I had not
seen him for a long time, and somehow his
being so much older and&mdash;and everything,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Di recalled the outward presentment of
Sir Henry&mdash;elderly, gouty, the worse for
town wear.</p>

<p>"I see," she said gravely.</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"I knew you would feel with me about
it," said Madeleine, affectionately. "I always
think you are so sympathetic."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<p>"But you <i>did</i> think it over&mdash;it did occur
to you before he asked you?" said the
sympathizer in rather a low voice.</p>

<p>"Oh yes! The night before I thought
of it."</p>

<p>"The night before?" echoed Di.</p>

<p>"Yes, that last evening at Narbury. I
don't know how it was; there were some
much prettier girls there than me, but I was
quite monopolized by the men&mdash;Lord Algy
and Captain Graham in particular; it was
really most embarrassing. I have such a
dislike to being made conspicuous. One on
each side of the piano, you know; and, as
I told them, they ought not to leave the
other girls in the way they were doing.
There were two girls who had no one to
speak to all the evening. I begged them
to go and talk to them, but they would not
listen; and Sir Henry stood about near, and
would insist on turning over, and somehow<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
suddenly I thought he meant something,
but I never thought it would be so quick.
Men are so strange. I sometimes think they
look at things <i>quite</i> differently from a woman.
It's such a solemn thought to me that we have
got to influence them, and draw them up."</p>

<p>"Or draw them on," said Di gravely&mdash;"one
or the other, or both at the same time.
Yes, it's very solemn. When did you say
Sir Henry became sudden?"</p>

<p>"Next morning&mdash;the very next morning,
after breakfast, in the orchid-house. I just
wandered in there to read my letters. It
took me entirely by surprise. It is such a
comfort to talk to you, dear Di. I know
you do enter into it all so."</p>

<p>"Not into the orchid-house," said Di,
looking straight in front of her.</p>

<p>"You naughty thing!" said Madeleine,
delightedly. "I shall shake you if you tease
like that."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>To threaten to shake any one was Madeleine's
sheet-anchor in the form of repartee.
Di knit her white brows.</p>

<p>"And though the idea had never so much
as crossed your mind till a few hours before,
still you accepted him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Madeleine, withdrawing her
hand with dignity; "of course I did not.
I don't know what other girls feel about it,
but with me there is something too solemn,
too sacred, in an engagement of that kind
to rush into it all in a moment. I told him
so, and that I must think it over, and that
I could not answer him anything at once."</p>

<p>"And how long did you think it over?"</p>

<p>"All that morning. I stayed by myself
in my own room. I did not go out, though
the others all went to a steeplechase on
Lord Algy's drag, and I had a new gown
on purpose. I suppose most girls would
have gone, but I felt I could not. I can't<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
take things lightly like some people. I dare
say it is a mistake, but I always have felt
anything of that kind very deeply."</p>

<p>"I suppose he did not go either?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, he didn't."</p>

<p>"That would have been awkward if you
had not intended to accept him."</p>

<p>Madeleine looked into the fire.</p>

<p>"It was a very painful time," she went on,
after a pause. "And it was so embarrassing
at luncheon&mdash;only him and me, and that old
General Hanbury. Every one else had
gone."</p>

<p>"Even your mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she was the chaperone of the
party, as Mrs. Mildmay had a headache.
But I did not want her to stay. She did
not know till it was all settled. I could not
have talked about it to her; mamma and I
feel so differently. You know she always
remembers how much she cared for poor<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
papa. I was dreadfully perplexed what I
ought to do, but"&mdash;in a lowered voice&mdash;"I
took it where I take all my troubles, Di.
I prayed over it; I laid it all before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Madeleine stopped short as Di suddenly
hid her face in her hands. The white nape
of her neck was crimson.</p>

<p>"And then?" she asked, after a moment's
silence, with her face still hidden.</p>

<p>"Then it all seemed to become clear,"
murmured Madeleine, gratified by Di's
evident envy. "And I saw it was <i>meant</i>.
You know, Di, I believe those things are
decided for one. And I felt quite peaceful,
and I went out for a little bit in the garden,
and the sun was setting&mdash;I always care so
much for sunsets, they mean so much to
me, and it was all so beautiful and calm;
and&mdash;I suppose he had seen me go out&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Di uttered a sound between a laugh and<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
a sob, which resulted in something like a
croak. Her fair face was red with&mdash;<i>was</i> it
envy?&mdash;as she raised her head. Two large
tears stood in her indignant wistful eyes.
She looked hard at Madeleine, and the latter
avoided her direct glance.</p>

<p>"Madeleine," she said, "do you care for
this man?"</p>

<p>Madeleine gave a little pout which would
have appealed to a masculine heart, but
which had no effect on Di.</p>

<p>"I was very much surprised when you
wrote to tell me," continued Di, rather
hurriedly. "I never should have thought&mdash;when
I remember what he is&mdash;I can't believe
that you can really care about him."</p>

<p>"I have a great influence over him&mdash;an
influence for good," said Madeleine. "He
would promise anything I asked; he has
already about smoking. I know he has not
<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>been always&mdash;&mdash; But you know a woman's
influence. I always mention him in my
prayers, Di."</p>

<p>Madeleine had been long in the habit of
presenting the names of her most eligible
acquaintances of the opposite sex to the
favourable consideration of the Almighty,
without whose co-operation she was aware
that nothing matrimonially advantageous
could be effected, and in whose powers as a
chaperon she placed more confidence than
in the feeble finite efforts of a kind but
unworldly mother. She had never so far
felt impelled to draw His attention to the
spiritual needs of younger sons.</p>

<p>"Every woman has an enormous influence
for the time over a man who is in love with
her," said Di, who seemed to have frozen
perceptibly. "It is nothing peculiar. It is
one of the common stock feelings on such
occasions. The question is, Do you really
care for him?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>Madeleine shivered a little, and then suddenly
burst into uncontrollable weeping. Di
was touched to the quick. Loss of self-control
sometimes moves reserved people
profoundly. They know that only an overwhelming
onslaught of emotion would be
able to wrest their own self-control from
them; and when they witness the loss of it
in another, they think that it must have been
caused by the same amount of suffering.</p>

<p>"I think you are very unkind, Di," Madeleine
said, between her sobs. "And I always
thought you would be the one to sympathize
with me when I was engaged. And I have
chosen the bridesmaids' gowns on purpose to
suit you, though I know Sir Henry's niece,
that little fat Dalrymple with her waist under
her arms, will look simply hideous in it. And
I wrote to you the <i>very</i> first! I think you
are very unkind!"</p>

<p>"Am I?" said Di, gently, as if she were<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
speaking to a child; and she knelt down by
the little sobbing figure and put her arms
round her. "Never mind about the bridesmaids'
gowns, dear. It was very nice of
you to think how they would suit me.
Never mind about anything but just this
one thing: Do you think you will be happy
if you marry Sir Henry Verelst?"</p>

<p>"Others do it," sobbed Madeleine. "Look
at Maud Lister, and she hated Lord Lentham&mdash;and
he was such a dreadful little man,
with a mole, worse than&mdash;&mdash; But she got
not to mind. And I've been out nine years.
You are only twenty-one, Di. It's all very
well for you to talk like that; I felt just the
same when I was your age. But I shall be
twenty-eight this year; and you don't know
what it feels like to be getting on, and one's
fringe not what it was; and always having
to pretend to be glad when one is bridesmaid
to girls younger than one's self, and<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
seeing other girls have <i>trousseaux</i>, and thinking,
perhaps, one will never have one at all.
I don't know how I could bear to live if I
was thirty and was not married!"</p>

<p>Di was silent for a moment from sheer
astonishment at a real declaration of feeling
from one who felt, and lived, and talked, and
dressed according to a social code fixed as
the laws of the Medes and Persians.</p>

<p>Her low voice had a certain tremor of
repressed emotion in it as she said: "But
think of Sir Henry. The bridegroom is part
of the wedding, after all; think of what he
is. What can you care for in him? Nothing.
I don't see how you could. And he
is twice your age. Be a brave girl, and
break it off."</p>

<p>Di felt as she said the last words that the
courage of being able to break off the
engagement was as nothing to that of continuing
to keep it. She did not realize that<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
an entire lack of imagination wears, under
certain circumstances, the appearance of the
most stoical fortitude.</p>

<p>The brave girl sobbed again, and pressed
a little frilled square of cambric to her eyes.</p>

<p>"No," she gasped; "I can't&mdash;I can't! It
has been in all the papers. Half my things
are ordered; I have asked the bridesmaids.
I can't go back now. It is wicked to break
off an engagement. God would be very
angry with me."</p>

<p>It is difficult to argue with any one who
can make a Jorkins of the Almighty. Every
word Madeleine spoke showed her friend
how unavailing any further remonstrance
would be. Di saw that she had gone through
that common phase of imagination which
a shallow nature feels to be prophetic.
Madeleine had, in what stood proxy for her
imagination, already regarded herself as a
bride, as the recipient, not of diamonds in<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
general, but of the Verelst diamonds in particular.
Already in maiden meditation she
had seen herself arrive at certain houses on
bridal visits&mdash;had contemplated herself opening
a county hunt ball as the bride of the
year&mdash;until she looked upon the wedding as
a settled event, the husband as a necessary
adjunct, the <i>trousseaux</i> as a certainty.</p>

<p>"And you must see my under-things when
they come, because we have always been
such friends," continued Madeleine, as Di remained
silent. She dried her eyes with little
dabs, for even in emotion she remembered
the danger of wiping them, while she favoured
Di with minute details respecting those complete
sets of under-clothing which so mysteriously
enhance and dignify the holy estate
of matrimony in the feminine mind. But Di
was not listening. The image of Sir Henry,
who had besought herself to marry him a
year ago, reverted to her mind with a remembrance<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
of her own repulsion towards the
Moloch to which Madeleine was preparing
to offer herself up.</p>

<p>"Madeleine," she said suddenly, "I am
sure from what I have seen that marriage is
too difficult if you don't care for your husband.
The married people who did not
marry for love tell one so by their faces. I
am sure there are some hard times to be
lived through even when you care very much.
Nothing but a great love, granny says, will
float one over some of the rocks ahead. But
to marry without love is like undertaking to
sew without a needle, or dig without a spade&mdash;attempting
difficult work without the tool
provided for it. Oh, Madeleine, don't do it!
Break it off&mdash;break it off!"</p>

<p>Madeleine clung closer to the girl kneeling
beside her. It almost seemed as if the
urgent eager voice were not speaking in
vain.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>A tap came at the door.</p>

<p>Di, always shy of betraying emotion, was
on her feet in a moment. Madeleine drew
the screen hastily between herself and the
light as she said, "Come in."</p>

<p>It was the French maid, who explained
that the dressmaker had sent the two rolls
of brocade as she had promised, so that
mademoiselle might judge of them in the
piece. She brought them in with her, and
spread them in artistic folds on two chairs.</p>

<p>Madeleine sat up and gave a little sigh.</p>

<p>"If she gives them up, she will give him
up, too," thought Di. "This is the turning-point."</p>

<p>"Di," she said earnestly, "which would
you advise, the mauve or the white and
gold? I always think you have such taste."</p>

<p>Di started and turned a shade pale. She
saw by that one sentence that the die had
been thrown, though Madeleine was not<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
herself aware of it. The moments of our
most important decisions are often precisely
those in which nothing seems to have been
decided; and only long afterwards, when we
perceive with astonishment that the Rubicon
has been crossed, do we realize that in that
half-forgotten instant of hesitation as to some
apparently unimportant side issue, in that
unconscious movement that betrayed a feeling
of which we were not aware, our choice was
made. The crises of life come, like the
Kingdom of Heaven, without observation.
Our characters, and not our deliberate actions,
decide for us; and even when the moment
of crisis is apprehended at the time by the
troubling of the water, action is generally a
little late. Character, as a rule, steps down
first. It was so with Madeleine.</p>

<p>Sir Henry owed his bride to the exactly
timed appearance of a mauve brocade
sprinkled with silver <i>fleur-de-lys</i>. The maid<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
turned it lightly, and the silver threads
gleamed through the rich pale material.</p>

<p>"It is perfect," said Madeleine in a hushed
voice; "absolutely perfect. Don't you think
so, Di? And she says she will do it for
forty guineas, as she is making me other
things. The front is to be a silver gauze
over plain mauve satin to match, and the
train of the brocade. The white and gold
is nothing to it."</p>

<p>"It is very beautiful," said Di, looking at
it with a kind of horror. It seemed to her
at the moment as if every one had their
price.</p>

<p>Madeleine smiled faintly. She felt that
Di must envy her. It was of course only
natural that she should do so. A thought
strayed across her mind that in the future
many gowns of this description, hitherto unobtainable
and unsuitable, might sweeten
existence; and she would be kind to Di.<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
She would press an old one, before it was
really old, on her occasionally.</p>

<p>Madeleine gave the sigh that accompanies
relaxation from intense mental strain.</p>

<p>"I will decide on the mauve," she said.</p>

<span class="hide">P</span>UT not your trust in brothers," said
Di, coming in from a balcony after
the departure of the bride and bridegroom,
and looking round the crowded drawing-room,
where the fictitious gaiety of a wedding
was more or less dismally stamped
on every face. "I do believe Archie has
deserted me."</p>

<p>"I know he has," said her companion.
"He told me half an hour ago that he was
going to bolt."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[115]</span></p>

<p>"Did he? The deceiver! He gave me
a solemn promise that he would see me
home. I believe young men are the root of
all evil. Don't pin your faith to them, Lord
Hemsworth, or you will live to rue it, like
me."</p>

<p>"I won't."</p>

<p>"And why, pray, did not you mention
the fact that he was going when I was
laboriously explaining all the presents to
you, and exhausting myself in pointing out
watches in bracelets or concealed in the
handles of umbrellas, which you were quite
unable to see for yourself? One good turn
deserves another. Ah! now the people are
really beginning to go. Is not that Lady
Breakwater in the inner drawing-room?
Poor woman&mdash;I mean, happy mother! I
will try and get near her to say good-bye.
Look at her smiling; I think I should know
a wedding smile anywhere."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>"No, you need not see me home," she
added a few minutes later, as she stood in
the hall. "Have I not a hired brougham?
One throws expense to the winds on an
occasion of this kind. There comes your
hansom behind it. What a lovely chestnut!
How I do envy you it! The blessings of
this world are very unevenly distributed.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>"I am going to see you home," said Lord
Hemsworth, with decision. "It is the duty
of the best man to make himself generally
useful to the chief bridesmaid. I've read it
in my little etiquette book; and, however
painful my duty may be made to me, I shall
perform it."</p>

<p>"You have performed it thoroughly
already. No, you are not coming in.
Don't shut the door on my gown, please.
Thanks. Home, coachman."</p>

<p>"Are you going to the Speaker's to-night?"<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
said Lord Hemsworth, with his
arms on the carriage-door, perfectly regardless
of the string of carriages behind
him.</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Good luck; so am I."</p>

<p>"That's not in the etiquette book," said
Di, with mischief in her eyes. "In the
meantime you are stopping the whole procession.
We have shaken hands once
already. Good-bye again."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Courtenay was sitting in her armchair
with her back to the light in the long
sunny drawing-room of her little house in
Kensington, waiting for the return of her
granddaughter from the wedding to which
at the last moment she had been unable
to escort her herself. Her headache was
better now, and she had taken up her work,
the fine elaborate lace work in imitation of<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
an old design which she had copied in some
Italian church.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtenay had been one of the four
beautiful Miss Digbys of Ebberstone about
whom society had gone wild fifty years ago;
and in her old age she was beautiful still,
with the dignified and gracious manner of
one who has been worshipped in her day.
Her calm keen face bore the marks of much
suffering, but of suffering that had been
outlived. Perhaps next to the death of her
husband, who had left her in her early youth
to struggle with life alone, the blow which
she had felt most keenly had been the clandestine
and most miserable marriage of her
only daughter with Colonel Tempest; but it
was all past now. People while they are
undergoing the strain of the ordinary
ills that flesh is heir to, the bitterness
of inadequately returned love, the loss or
alienation of children, the grind of poverty<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
or the hydra-headed wants of insufficient
wealth, are not as a rule pleasant or sympathetic
companions. The lessons of life are
coming too quickly upon them to allow of it.
They are preoccupied. But <i>tout passe</i>. Mrs.
Courtenay had loved and had suffered, and
had presented a brave front to the world,
and had known wealth, as she now knew
poverty. The pain was past; the experience
remained; therein lay the secret of her
power and her popularity, for she had both.
She seemed to have reached a little quiet
backwater in the river of life where the
pressure of the current could no longer reach
her, would never reach her again. She sometimes
said that nothing could affect her very
deeply now, except, perhaps, what affected
her granddaughter. But that was a large
exception. Mrs. Courtenay loved her
granddaughter with some of the stern tender
affection which she had once lavished on her<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
own daughter&mdash;which she had buried in her
grave. The elder Diana had taken two
hearts down to the grave with her&mdash;her
mother's and Mr. Tempest's.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtenay had that rarest gift&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A heart at leisure from itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To soothe and sympathize."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To that little house in Kensington many
came, long before her beautiful granddaughter
was of an age to be its principal
attraction, as she had now become. Mrs.
Courtenay's house had gained the magic
name of being agreeable, possibly because
she made it so to one and all alike. None
but the pushing and the dictatorial were
ever overlooked. Country relations with
the loud voices and the abusive political
views peculiar to rural life were her worst
bugbears, but even they had a pleasing suspicion
that they had distinguished themselves
in conversation, and departed with<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
the gratified feeling akin to that depicted on
a plain woman's face when she has come
out well in a photograph.</p>

<p>In talking with the young Mrs. Courtenay
remembered her own far-away youth, its
romantic passions, its watchful nights, its
splendour of sunrise illusions. She remembered,
too, its great ignorance, and was not,
like so many elders, exasperated with the
young for having omitted to learn, before
they came into the world, what they themselves
only learned by living half a century
in it.</p>

<p>She had sympathy with old and young
alike, but perhaps she felt most deeply for
those who were struggling in the meshes
of middle age, no longer interesting to others
or even to themselves. Many came to Mrs.
Courtenay for comfort and sympathy in the
servitude with hard labour of middle age,
and none came in vain.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[122]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Courtenay lifted her calm clear eyes
to the Louis Quatorze clock on the old
Venetian cabinet near her.</p>

<p>"Di is late," she said half aloud.</p>

<p>The low sun was thinking better of it,
and was shining in through the tracery of
the bare branches of the trees outside. If
there was ever a ray of sunshine anywhere,
it was in that little Kensington drawing-room.
The sun never forgot to seek it out,
to come and have a look at the little possessions
which in spite of her narrow means
Mrs. Courtenay had gradually gathered
round her. It came now, and touched the
white <i>Capo di Monte</i> figures on the mantelpiece,
and brought into momentary prominence
the inlaid ivory dolphins on the ebony
cabinet; those dolphins with curly tails
which two Dianas had loved at the age
when permission to drive dolphins and sit
on waves was not a final impossibility<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
though denied for the moment. It lighted
up the groups of Lowestoft china, and the
tall Oriental jars which Mrs. Courtenay
suffered no one to dust but herself. The
little bits of old silver and enamel on the
black polished table caught the light. So
did the daffodils in the green Vallauris
tripod. They blazed against the shadowed
pictured wall. The quiet room was full of
light.</p>

<p>Presently a carriage stopped at the door,
the bell rang, and a moment later a swift
light step mounted the stair, and Di came
in, tall and radiant in her flowing white and
yellow draperies, her bouquet of mimosa in
her hand.</p>

<p>She was beautiful, with the beauty that
is recognized at once. Beauty is so rare
nowadays and prettiness so common, that
the terms are often confused and misapplied,
and the most ordinary good looks usurp<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
the name of beauty. But between prettiness
and beauty there is nevertheless a
great gulf fixed. No one had ever called
Di a pretty girl. At one and twenty she
was a beautiful woman, with that nameless
air of distinction which can ennoble the
plainest face and figure.</p>

<p>She had a right to beauty from both
parents, and resembled both of them to a
certain degree. She had the tall splendid
figure of the Tempests with their fair skin
and pale golden hair, waving back thick and
burnished from her low white forehead.
But she had her mother's dark unfathomable
eyes with the long dark eyelashes, and her
mother's features with their inherent nobility
and strength, which were so entirely lacking
in the Tempests&mdash;at least, in the present
generation of them. Some people, women
mostly, said there was too much contrast between
her dark eyes and eyebrows and the<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
extreme fairness of her complexion and hair.
Men, however, did not think so. They saw
that she was beautiful, and that was enough.
Indeed, it was too much for some of them.
Women said, also, that her features were too
large, that she was on too large a scale
altogether. No doubt that accounted for
the fact that she was seldom overlooked.</p>

<p>"Well, Granny, and how is the headache?"
she asked gaily, pulling off her long
gloves and instantly beginning to unwire the
mimosa in her bouquet with rapid, capable
white hands.</p>

<p>"Oh! the headache is gone," said Mrs.
Courtenay, watching her granddaughter.
"And how did it all go off?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said Di, in her clear gay
voice. "Madeleine looked beautiful, and
often as I have been bridesmaid I never
stood behind a bride with a better fitting
back. I suppose the survival of the best<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
fitted is what we are coming to in these
days. Anyhow, Madeleine attained to it.
It was a well done thing altogether. The
altar one mass of white peonies! White
peonies at Easter! Sir Henry was the only
red one there. And eight of us all youth
and innocence in white and amber to bear
her company. We bridesmaids were all
waiting for her for some time before she
arrived or he either; but Lord Hemsworth
marched him in at last, just when I was
beginning to hope he would not turn up. I
have seen him look worse, Granny. He did
not look so very bald until he knelt down,
and I have known his nose redder. To a
friend I dare say it only looked like a
blush that had lost its way. He is a stout
man to outline himself in a white waistcoat,
but I thought on the whole he looked
well."</p>

<p>"Di," said Mrs. Courtenay, with her little<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
inward laugh, "you should not say such
things."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I can say anything I like to
you," said Di. "Dear me, I am sitting on
my new amber sash! What extravagance!
It will be long enough before I have another.
It was really good of Lady Breakwater to
give me the whole turn-out. We never
could have afforded it."</p>

<p>"Did Madeleine look unhappy?"</p>

<p>"No; she was pale, but perfectly collected,
and she walked quite firmly to the
chancel steps where the security for fifteen
thousand a year and two diamond tiaras and
a pendant was awaiting her. The security
looked a little nervous."</p>

<p>"Di," said Mrs. Courtenay, with an effort
after severity, "never again let me hear you
laugh at the man who once did you the
honour to ask you to marry him. You
show great want of feeling."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[128]</span></p>

<p>Di's face changed. It became several
degrees sterner than her grandmother's.
That peculiar concentrated light came into
her soft lovely eyes which is a life-long
puzzle to those who can see only one aspect
of a character, and whose ideas are consequently
thrown into the wildest confusion by
a change of expression. There was at times
an appearance of intensity of feeling about
Di which sometimes gleamed up into her
eyes and gave a certain tremor to her low
voice, that surprised and almost frightened
those who regarded her only as a charming
but somewhat eccentric woman. Di's best
friends said they did not understand her.
The little foot-rule by which they measured
others did not seem to apply to her. She
was grave or gay, cynical or tender, frivolous
or sympathetic, according to the mood
of the hour, or according as her quick intuition
and sense of mischief showed her the<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
exact opposite was expected of her. But
behind the various moods which naturally
high spirits led her into for the moment,
keener eyes could see that there was always
something kept back&mdash;something not suffered
to be discussed and commented on by the
crowd&mdash;namely, herself. Her frank, cordial
manner might deceive the many, but others
who knew her better were conscious of a
great reserve&mdash;of a barrier beyond which
they might not pass; of locked rooms in
that sunny, hospitable house into which no
one was invited, into which she had, perhaps,
as yet rarely penetrated herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtenay possibly understood her
better than any one, but Di took her by
surprise now. She laid down her flowers
and came and stood before her grandmother.</p>

<p>"Do I show want of feeling?" she said,
in her low, even voice. "I know I have
none for that man; but why should I have<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
any? If he wanted to marry me, why did
he want it? He knew I did not like him&mdash;I
made that sufficiently plain. Did he care
one single straw for anything about me
except my looks? If he had liked me ever
so little, it would have been different; but
why am I to be grateful because he wanted
me to sit at the head of his table, and wear
his diamonds?"</p>

<p>"You talk as young and silly girls with
romantic ideas do talk," replied Mrs. Courtenay,
piqued into making assertions exactly
contrary to her real opinions. "I fancied
you had more sense! Madeleine did a wise
thing in accepting him. She has made a
very prudent marriage."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Di, moving slowly away and
sitting down by the window&mdash;"that is just
it. I wonder if there is anything in the
whole wide world so recklessly imprudent as
a prudent marriage? But what am I talking<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
about?" she added, lightly. "It is not a
marriage; it is merely a social contract. I
can't see why they went to church myself, or
what the peonies and that nice little newly-ironed
Bishop were for. They were quite
unnecessary. A register-office and a clerk
would have done just as well, and have been
more in keeping. But how silly it is of me
to be wasting my time in holding forth when
your cap is not even trimmed for this evening.
The price of a virtuous woman is above
rubies nowadays. Nothing but diamonds
and settlements will secure a first-rate article.
And now, to come back to more serious subjects,
will you wear your diamond stars, G"&mdash;("G"
was the irreverent pet name by
which Di sometimes called her grandmother)&mdash;"or
shall I fasten that little marabou
feather with your pearl clasp into the point-lace
cap? It wants something at the side."</p>

<p>"I think I will wear the diamonds," said<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
Mrs. Courtenay, thoughtfully. "People are
beginning to wear their jewels again now.
Only sew them in firmly, Di."</p>

<p>"You should have seen the array of
jewellery to-day," said Di, still in the same
tone, arranging the mimosa in clusters about
the room. "Other people's diamonds seem
to take all the starch out of me. A kind of
limpness comes over me when I look at
tiaras. And there was such a <i>rivi&egrave;re</i> and
pendant! And a little hansom cab and
horse in diamonds as a brooch. I should
like to be tempted by a brooch like that.
Sir Henry has his good points, after all. I
see it now that it is too late. And why do
people sprinkle themselves all over with
watches nowadays, Granny, in unexpected
places? Lord Hemsworth counted five&mdash;was
it, or six?&mdash;set in different presents.
There were two, I think, in bracelets, one in
a fan, and one in the handle of an umbrella.<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
What can be the use of a watch in the
handle of an umbrella? Then there was a
very little one in&mdash;what was it?&mdash;a paper-knife,
set round with large diamonds. It
made me feel quite unwell to look at it when
I thought how what had been spent on that
silly thing would have dressed you and me,
Granny, for a year. That reminds me&mdash;I
shall tear off this amber sash and put it on
my white <i>miroitant</i> dinner-gown. You must
not give me any more white gowns; they
are done for directly."</p>

<p>"I like to see you in white."</p>

<p>"Oh! so do I&mdash;just as much as I like to
see you, Granny, in brocade; but it can't be
done. I won't have you spending so much
on me. If I am a pauper, I don't mind
looking like one."</p>

<p>She looked very unlike one as she gathered
up her gloves and lace handkerchief and
bouquet holder, and left the room. And yet<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
they were very poor. No one knew on how
small a number of hundreds that little home
was kept together, how narrow was the
margin which allowed of those occasional
little dinner-parties of eight to which people
were so glad to come. Who was likely to
divine that the two black satin chairs had
been covered by Di's strong hands&mdash;that the
pale Oriental coverings on the settees and
sofas that harmonized so well with the subdued
colouring of the room were the result of
her powers of upholstery&mdash;that it was Di who
mounted boldly on high steps and painted
her own room and her grandmother's an
elegant pink distemper, inciting the servants
to go and do likewise for themselves?</p>

<p>It was easy to see they were poor, but it
was generally supposed that they had the
species of limited means which wealth is
so often kind enough to envy, with its old
formula that the truly rich are those who<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
have nothing to keep up. This is true if
the narrow means have not caused the wants
to become so circumscribed that nothing
further remains that can <i>be put down</i>. The
rich, one would imagine, are those who,
whatever their income may be, have it in
their power to put down an unnecessary
expense. But probably all expenses are
essentially necessary to the wealthy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtenay and her granddaughter
lived very quietly, and went without effort,
and, indeed, as a matter of course, into that
society which is labelled, whether rightly or
wrongly, as "good."</p>

<p>Persons of narrow means too often slip
out of the class to which they naturally
belong, because they can give nothing in
return for what they receive. They may
have a thousand virtues, and be far superior
in their domestic relations to those who
forget them, but they <i>are</i> forgotten, all the<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
same. Society is rigorous, and gives nothing
for nothing.</p>

<p>But others there are whose poverty makes
no difference to them, who are welcomed
with cordiality, and have reserved seats
everywhere because, though they cannot pay
in kind, they have other means at their
disposal. Their very presence is an overpayment.
Every one who goes into society
must, in some form or other, as Mrs. Lynn
Linton expresses it, "pay their shot." All
the doors were open to Mrs. Courtenay and
her granddaughter, not because they were
handsomer than other people, not because
they belonged by birth to "good" society,
and were only to be seen at the "best"
houses, but because, wherever they went,
they were felt to be an acquisition, and one
not invariably to be obtained.</p>

<p>Madeleine had been glad to book Di at
once as one of her bridesmaids. Indeed, she
had long professed a great affection for the<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
younger girl, with whom she had nothing
in common, but whose beauty rendered it
probable that she might eventually make a
brilliant match.</p>

<p>As the bridesmaid sat down rather wearily
in her own room, and unfastened the diamond
monogram brooch&mdash;"the gift of the bridegroom"&mdash;the
tears that had been in her
heart all day came into her eyes; Di's slow,
difficult tears.</p>

<p>What a mass of illusions are torn from us
by the first applauded mercenary marriage
that comes very near to us in our youth!
Death, when he draws nigh for the first
time, at least leaves us our illusions; but
this voluntary death in life, from which there
is no resurrection, filled Di's soul with
loathing compassion. She bowed her fair
head on her hands and wept over the girl
who had never been her friend, but whose
fate might at one time have been her own.</p>

Speaker's, the usual sprinkling of
stars and orders, and splendid uniforms. If
it made Di feel limp to look at other people's
diamonds, she would be very limp to-night.</p>

<p>Two men with their backs to the wall,
somewhat withdrawn from the moving pressure
of the crowd, were commenting in the
absolute privacy of a large gathering on the
stream of arrivals.</p>

<p>"Who is that old parchment face and the<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
eyeglass?" asked the younger man, whose
bleached eyes and moustache betokened
foreign service.</p>

<p>"Which?"</p>

<p>"Coming in now; looks as if he had seen
a thing or two. There&mdash;he is talking to one
of the Arden twins."</p>

<p>"That man? That is Lord Frederick
Fane, an old reprobate. See, he has buttonholed
Hemsworth. I should like to hear
what he is saying to him. Look how his
eye twinkles. He is one of our instructors
of youth."</p>

<p>"Hemsworth has been standing there for
the last half-hour."</p>

<p>"He is waiting; anybody can see that.
So am I, though not for the same person."</p>

<p>"Whom are you looking out for?"</p>

<p>"Do you see that dark man with the
high nose, talking to the Post Office?
There&mdash;the Duchess of Southark has just<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
spoken to him, and is introducing her
daughter."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that ugly beggar with the
clean-shaved face and heavy jaw?"</p>

<p>"I don't see that he is so ugly. He has
got a head on his shoulders, and his face
means something, which is more than you
can say of many. There is no lack of ability
there. He is one of the men of the future,
and people are beginning to find it out. He
has not taken any line in politics yet, but he
is bound to soon. Both sides want him, of
course. He is one of our most promising
Commoners, Tempest of Overleigh."</p>

<p>The younger man glanced at the square-shouldered
erect figure and strong dark face
with deep interest.</p>

<p>"Is he the man about whom there was
a lawsuit when his father died?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Colonel Tempest brought an action,
but he lost it. There was no evidence<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
forthcoming, though there was very little
doubt how matters really stood."</p>

<p>"He is not like the Tempests."</p>

<p>"No; if you want a Tempest pure and
simple, look at the man with tow-coloured
hair in the further doorway, making running
with the little soda-water heiress. That is
the regular Tempest style."</p>

<p>"He is too beautiful; he has overdone
it," said the other. "If he were less handsome,
he would be better looking, and his
hair looks like a wig. He has the face of
a fool on him."</p>

<p>"The last two generations have had no grit
in them. Jack Tempest, the last man, might
have done something, but he never came to
the fore. He was a trustworthy Conservative,
but not an energetic man like his father, the
old minister, who lies in Westminster Abbey."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the present man will come to
the fore."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>"Perhaps! I know he will; you can see
it in his face, and he has the <i>prestige</i> of his
name and wealth to back him. But I don't
know which side he will take. I know that
he voted right at the last election, but so did
half the Liberals. I incline to think he has
Liberal leanings, but he refused to stand
three years ago for the family constituency,
which is an absolute certainty whatever he
professes himself, and he has been secretary
to the Embassy at St. Petersburg for the
last three years."</p>

<p>"He is very like his mother's family,
except that the Fanes are not so ugly."</p>

<p>"Of course he is like his mother's family;
it's an open secret. Look at him now; he
is speaking to Lord Frederick Fane, his
mother's&mdash;first cousin. There's a family
resemblance for you! I wonder they stand
together."</p>

<p>His companion drew in his breath. The<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
likeness between the elder man and the
young one was unmistakable.</p>

<p>"Does he know, do you think?" he asked
after a moment.</p>

<p>"Of course he must know that there is a
'but' about himself. People don't grow up
in ignorance of such things; but I should
think he does <i>not</i> know that it is more than
a suspicion, that it is a moral certainty, and
that Lord Frederick&mdash;&mdash; But it is seven
and twenty years ago, and it is half forgotten
now. He is not the only heir with a doubt
about him. He will be a credit to the
Tempests, anyhow. If the property had
fallen into the hands of those two thieves,
Colonel Tempest and his son, there would
not have been much left of it for the next
generation."</p>

<p>"It's frightfully hot!" said the younger
man. "I shall bolt."</p>

<p>"Just home from Africa, and find it hot!"<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
said the other. "Ah!"&mdash;with sudden interest,
looking back to the doorway&mdash;"I
thought so. Hemsworth was not waiting
for nothing. By &mdash;&mdash; she <i>is</i> handsome, and
what a figure! She is the tallest woman in
the room except Lady Delmour's two yards
of unmarriageable maypole. Look how she
moves, and the way her head is set on her
shoulders. If I had not a wife and seven
children, I should make a fool of myself. I
remember her mother, just as handsome
twenty years ago, but not so brilliant, and
with an unhappy look about her. Hang
Tempest! I won't wait any longer for him.
I must go and speak to her before Hemsworth
takes possession of her."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"You take my advice, John," said Lord
Frederick Fane confidentially to his kinsman;
"don't tie yourself to a party any more
than you would to a woman. Leave that for<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
fools like Hemsworth. Just go your own
way, and give no one a claim on you."</p>

<p>"I intend to go my own way when I have
decided where I want to go."</p>

<p>"Well, in the meanwhile don't commit
yourself. Always leave yourself a loop-hole."</p>

<p>"I don't see the use of worrying about
loop-holes if I don't want to back out of anything.
I shall never consciously put myself
anywhere where it might be necessary to
wriggle out on all fours."</p>

<p>"Oh! I dare say. I thought all that in
my salad days, but you'll grow out of it as
you get older. You'll chip your shell, John,
like the rest of us, he! he! and not be above
a shift. There's not a man who won't stoop
to a shift on a pinch, provided the pinch is
sharp enough, any more than there is a
woman, bespoken or otherwise, who does
not like being made love to, provided it<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
is done the right way. That is my experience."</p>

<p>Lord Frederick's experience was that of
most men of his stamp, the crown of whose
maturer years, earned by a youth of strenuous
self-indulgence, is a disbelief in human
nature. Secret contempt of women, coupled
with a smooth and adulatory manner towards
them, show only too plainly the school in
which these opinions have been formed.</p>

<p>"Look at Hemsworth," continued Lord
Frederick, as Mrs. Courtenay and Di, and
Lord Hemsworth in close attendance, were
being gradually drifted towards the room in
which they were standing. "If Hemsworth
goes on giving that girl a hold over him, he
will find himself deuced uncomfortable one
of these days. He had better hold hard
while he can. Discretion is the better part
of valour. I've been telling him so."</p>

<p>"Why should he hold hard?" said John,<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
rather absently. "After all, none but the
brave deserve the fair."</p>

<p>"And none but the brave can live with
some of them. He, he!" said Lord
Frederick, chuckling. "There are cheaper
ways of getting out of love than by marriage;
but she is a fine woman. Hemsworth has
got eyes in his head, I must own. I remember
being dreadfully in love with her
mother, nearly thirty years ago, and she with
me. She had that sort of stand-off manner
which takes some men more than anything;
it did me. I wonder more women don't
adopt it. I very nearly married her. He,
he! But Tempest, your uncle, made a fool
of himself while I hesitated, and was
wretched with her, poor devil! I have
never had such a shave since. Upon my
word" putting up his eyeglass&mdash;"if I were
a young man, I think I'd marry Di Tempest.
Those large women wear well, John; they<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
don't shrivel up to nothing like Mrs. Graham,
or expand like Lady Torrington, that emblem
of plenty without waist. He, he!
Look at Mrs. Courtenay, too. There's a
fine old pelican with an eye to the main
chance. Always look at the mother and the
grandmother if you can. But she is on too
large a scale for you."</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said John, calmly. "I
cherish thoughts of Miss Delmour, who is
quite three inches taller."</p>

<p>"Don't marry a Delmour! They are too
thin. Those girls have neither mind, body,
nor estate. I have seen two generations of
them. They have a sort of prettiness when
they are quite new; but look at her married
sisters. They all look as if they had shrunk
in the wash."</p>

<p>"I must go and speak to Mrs. Courtenay,"
said John, from whose impenetrable face it
would have been difficult to judge whether<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
his companion's style of conversation amused
or disgusted him. "Three years' absence
blunts the recollection of one's friends."
And he moved away towards the next room.
The recollection of a good many people,
however, had apparently not become blunted,
and it was some time before he could make
his way to Mrs. Courtenay, who was talking
with a Turkish Ambassador and revolutionizing
his ideas of English women.</p>

<p>She was genuinely glad to see John, having
known him from a boy.</p>

<p>"You know your cousin Diana, of course?"
she said, as Di came towards them.</p>

<p>"Indeed I do not," said John. "I asked
who she was at the Thesinger wedding to-day,
and found myself in the ludicrous position
of not knowing my own first cousin."</p>

<p>"Not recognizing her, you mean?" said
Mrs. Courtenay. "Surely you must have
seen her often in my house before you went<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
abroad; but I suppose she was in a chrysalis
school-room state then, and has emerged
into young ladyhood since. Here is your
cousin saying he does not know you," continued
Mrs. Courtenay, turning to Di.
"John, this is Di. Di, this is your first
cousin, John Tempest."</p>

<p>Both bowed, and then thought better of it
and shook hands. Their eyes met on the
exact level of equal height, and the steady
keen glance that passed between was like
the meeting of two formidable powers. Each
was taken by surprise. It was as if, instead
of shaking hands, they had suddenly measured
swords.</p>

<p>"If you don't know each other you ought
to," continued Mrs. Courtenay. "Lord
Hemsworth, what is that unwholesome-looking
compound you have got hold of?"</p>

<p>"Lemonade for Miss Tempest."</p>

<p>"Kindly fetch me some too." And Mrs.<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
Courtenay turned away to continue her conversation
with the Turk, who was still hovering
near, and whose bead-like eyes under his
red fez showed a decided envy of John.</p>

<p>He and Di were standing in the doorway
that led into the last room where the refreshments
were, and a stream of people beginning
at that moment to press out again, pressed
them back into the room they had just been
leaving.</p>

<p>"I shall upset this down some one's back
in another minute and make an enemy for
life," said Di, holding her glass as best she
could. She would have given anything at
that instant to say something unusually
frivolous in order to shake off the impression
of the moment before; but her frivolity had
temporarily departed with Lord Hemsworth.</p>

<p>"Don't oppose the stream; subside into
this backwater," said John, placing his
square shoulders between the throng and<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
herself, and nodding to a recess by one of
the high arched windows.</p>

<p>Having reached it, Di sipped the highwater
mark off her lemonade.</p>

<p>"It's safe now," she said. "I don't know
why I took it; I don't want it now I've got
it. Have you seen Archie since you came
back? You know <i>him</i>, of course? He often
talks about you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw him at the Thesinger wedding
to-day."</p>

<p>"Were you there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but only at the church. I did not
go on to the house; I disliked the whole
affair too much. Many marriages, half the
marriages one sees, are only irrevocable
flirtations; but the ceremony of to-day was
not even that."</p>

<p>Di looked away through the mullioned
window out across the river and its gliding
shimmer to the lights beyond. She did<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
not know how long it was before she
spoke.</p>

<p>"I think it was a great sin," she said, at
last, in a low voice, unconscious of a pause
that to her companion was full of meaning.</p>

<p>"Or a great mistake," he said, gently.</p>

<p>"No, not a mistake," said Di, still looking
out. "The others, the irrevocable flirtations,
are the mistakes. There was no mistake
to-day. But it was a dull wedding," she
added, with sudden self-recollection and a
change of manner. "Not like one I was at
last autumn in the country. I was staying
in the same house as the bridegroom, and he
and the best man, a Mr. Lumley, got up at
an early hour, woke some of the other men,
and paraded the house with an <i>impromptu</i>
band of music. I remember the bridegroom
performed piercingly upon the comb. I
wonder people ever play the comb; it is so
plaintive. But perhaps it is your favourite<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
instrument, perfected in the course of foreign
travel, and I am trampling on your feelings
unawares."</p>

<p>"I used to play upon it," said John, "but
not of late years. I left it off because it
tickled and increased the natural melancholy
of my disposition. What were the other
instruments?"</p>

<p>"Let me see, Lord Hemsworth murmured
upon a gong, and Mr. Lumley uttered his
dark speech upon a tray. The whole was
very effective. He told me afterwards that
it was a relief to his feelings, which had been
much lacerated by the misplaced affections
of the bride."</p>

<p>Di's laughing mischievous eyes met John's
fixed upon her with a grave attention that
took her aback. She had an uncomfortable
sense that he was regarding her with secret
amusement. A moment before she had
been sorry that she had inadvertently spoken<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
with a force that was unusual to her. Now
she was equally vexed that she had been
flippant.</p>

<p>"Here you are," said Lord Hemsworth,
elbowing his way up to them. "I have
been looking for you everywhere. Mrs.
Courtenay is going, and is asking for you."</p>

<span class="hide">D</span>I," said Mrs. Courtenay, as they drove
away at last, after the usual half-hour's
waiting for the carriage, the tedium
of which Lord Hemsworth had exerted
himself to relieve, "do you usually talk quite
so much nonsense to Lord Hemsworth as
you did to-night?"</p>

<p>"Generally, granny. Yes, I think it was
about the usual quantity. Sometimes it is
rather more, a good deal more, when you
are not there."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Courtenay was silent for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>"You are making a mistake, Di," she said
at last.</p>

<p>"How, granny?"</p>

<p>"In your manner to Lord Hemsworth.
You make yourself cheap to him. A woman
should never do that!"</p>

<p>Di did not answer.</p>

<p>"When I was young," said Mrs. Courtenay,
"I should have been proud to have
been admired by a man of his stamp."</p>

<p>"So should I," said Di, quietly, "if I did
not like him so much."</p>

<p>"You do like him, then?"</p>

<p>"I do, and I mean to act on the square
by him!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do, granny, perfectly! I have
known him too long to alter my manner to
him. I know him by heart. If I once<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
begin to be serious and reserved with him,
if I once fail to keep him at arm's length,
which talking nonsense does, his feeling
towards me, which only amuses him now,
will become serious too. Lord Hemsworth
is not so superficial as he seems. He would
have been in earnest before now if I would
have let him, and he is the kind of man
who could be very much in earnest. I can't
help his playing with edged tools, but I <i>can</i>
prevent his cutting himself."</p>

<p>"My dear, he is in love with you now,
and has been for the last six months."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Di, "he is in a way; but he
would be much worse if he had had encouragement."</p>

<p>"And what do you call allowing him to
talk to you for half an hour on the stairs,
if it is not encouragement? You may be
certain there was not a creature there who
did not think you were encouraging him."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>"I don't mind what creatures think, as
long as I don't <i>do</i> the thing. And he knows
well enough I don't!"</p>

<p>"Why <i>not</i> do it, if you like him?"</p>

<p>"Well, granny," said Di, after a pause,
"the way I look at it is this. I don't mean
only about Lord Hemsworth, but about any
one who, well, who is interested in me&mdash;really
interested in me, I mean; not one of
the sham ones who want to pass the time.
I never consider them. I say something
like this to myself. 'Di, do you observe
that man?' 'Yes,' I say, 'my eye is upon
him.' 'Are you aware that he will come
and speak to you the first instant he can?'
'Yes, I know that.' 'Look at him well.'
Then I look at him. 'What do you think
of him?' 'He is rather nice-looking,' I say,
'and he is pleasant to talk to, and he has
the right kind of collars. I like him.' 'Di,'
I say to myself very solemnly&mdash;you have no<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
idea how solemn I am on these occasions&mdash;'are
you willing to prefer him to the rest of
the whole universe, to listen to his conversation
for the remainder of your natural life,
to knock under to him entirely; in short, to
take him and his collars for better for worse?'
'No, of course not,' I say indignantly; 'I
should not think of such a thing!' 'Then,'
I reply, 'you have no earthly right to let
him think you might be persuaded to; or to
allow him to take a single one of the preliminary
steps in that direction, however
gratifying it may be to your vanity to see
him do it, or however sorry you may be to
lose him. He is paying you the highest
compliment a man can pay a woman. One
good turn deserves another. He has seen
you looking at him. Here he comes to try
the first rung of the ladder. Stop him at
once, before he has climbed high enough for
a fall. He will soon go away if he thinks<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
you are heartless and frivolous. Well, then,
he is a good fellow. He deserves it at your
hands. Let him think you heartless, and
send him away none the worse.' That is
something of what I feel about men&mdash;I mean
the nice ones, granny."</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtenay raised her eyes to the
ceiling of the carriage, and her two hands
made a simultaneous upheaval under her
voluminous wraps. Her hopes for Lord
Hemsworth had suffered a severe shock
during the last few minutes, and words were
a relief.</p>

<p>"Of all the egregious folly I have heard
in the course of a long life," she remarked,
"I think that takes the palm. How do you
suppose any woman in the whole world, or
man either, would marry if they looked
at marriage like that? Things come
gradually."</p>

<p>"Not with me, granny," said Di, promptly.<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
"Either I see them or I don't see them;
and at the beginning I always look on to
the end, just as one does in a novel to see
whether it is worth reading. I can't pretend
to myself when I walk in the direction of
church bells that I don't know I shall arrive
at the church in the end, however pleasant
the walk may be."</p>

<p>"You will never marry, so you may as
well make up your mind to it," said Mrs.
Courtenay, who was already revolving an
entirely new idea in her mind, which cast
Lord Hemsworth completely into the shade.
"If you are so fond of looking at the future,
you had better amuse yourself by picturing
yourself as a penniless old maid."</p>

<p>"I wish there was something one could
be between an old maid and a married
woman," said Di. "I think if I had my
choice I would be a widow."</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtenay, somewhat propitiated<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
by her new idea, gave her silent but visible
laugh, and Di went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you think of John Tempest,
granny? He is so black that talking of
widows reminded me of him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtenay sustained a slight nervous
shock.</p>

<p>"I had not much conversation with him,"
she said, stifling a slight yawn. "I am glad
to see him back in England. Remind me
to ask him next time we have a dinner-party."</p>

<p>"He looks clever," said Di. "Ugly men
sometimes do. It is a way they have."</p>

<p>"It does not matter how ugly a man is if
he looks like a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said Di. "I am only sorry
he looks as if he had been cut out with a
blunt pair of scissors because he is a Tempest,
and Tempests ought to be handsome to
keep up the family traditions. Look at the<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
old man in Westminster Abbey. I am proud
of his nose whenever I look at it. I wish
the present head of the family had kept a
firmer hold on that feature, that is all; and,
it being a hook, I should have thought he
might easily have done so. I think it is a
want of good taste to bring the Fane
features so prominently to Overleigh, don't
you? Archie represents the looks of the
family certainly, and so do I, granny, though
I believe you fondly imagine I am not aware
of it. But it does not matter so much what
we look like, as it does with the head of
the family."</p>

<p>"The family has got a head to it for the
first time for two generations," remarked
Mrs. Courtenay, closing the conversation by
putting on her respirator.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As Lord Hemsworth turned away from
putting Mrs. Courtenay and Di into their<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
carriage he saw John coming down the
steps.</p>

<p>"Still here?" he said. "I thought you
had gone hours ago."</p>

<p>"It is a fine night," said John, who did
not think it necessary to say that he <i>was</i> still
there; "I think I shall walk."</p>

<p>"So will I," replied Lord Hemsworth,
and they went out together.</p>

<p>John and Lord Hemsworth had known
each other since the Eton days, and had that
sort of quiet liking for each other which has
the germ of friendship in it, which circumstances
may eventually quicken or destroy.</p>

<p>As they turned into Whitehall a hansom,
one of many, passed them at a foot's pace,
with its usual civil interrogatory, "Cab, sir?"</p>

<p>"That cab horse with the white stocking
reminds me," said Lord Hemsworth, "that
I was looking at a bay mare at Tattersall's
to-day for my team. I wish you would<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
come and see her, Tempest. I like her
looks, and she is a good match to the other
bay, but she has a white stocking."</p>

<p>"I don't see any harm in one," said John,
with interest; "but it rather depends on
the rest of the team."</p>

<p>"That is just it," said Lord Hemsworth.
"I drive a scratch team this year, two greys
and two bays with black points. She is
right height, good action, not too high, and
has been driven as a wheeler, which is what
I want her for; but I don't like the idea of
a white stocking among them."</p>

<p>And talking of one of the subjects that
most Englishmen have in common, they
proceeded slowly past the Horse Guards
and into Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p>"Tempest," said Lord Hemsworth, after
a time, "do you know it strikes me very
forcibly that we are being followed?"</p>

<p>"Not likely," said John.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>"Not at all likely, but the fact all the
same. Look there, that is the same hansom
waiting at the corner that hailed us as we
came out of the gates. I know him by the
white stocking."</p>

<p>"I should imagine there might be about
five hundred and one cab horses with white
stockings in London."</p>

<p>"I dare say, but I know a horse again
when I see him just as much as I know a
face. I bet you anything you like that is
the same horse."</p>

<p>"I dare say it is," said John absently.</p>

<p>Lord Hemsworth said nothing more.
They walked up St. James's Street in silence.</p>

<p>"I have taken rooms here for the moment,"
said John, stopping at the corner of
King Street. "I will come round to Tattersall's
about two to-morrow. Good night."</p>

<p>Lord Hemsworth bade him good night,
and then walked on up St. James's Street<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>.
There were a few hansoms on the stand.
The last, which was in the act of drawing
up behind the others, had a horse with a
white stocking.</p>

<p>"Now," said Lord Hemsworth to himself,
"we will see whether it is Tempest or me
he is after, for I am certain it is one of us."</p>

<p>He stopped short near the cab-stand, and,
striking a light, lit a cigarette, holding the
match so that his face was plainly visible.
Then he proceeded leisurely on his way and
turned down Piccadilly. There were a good
many people in the street and a certain
number of carriages.</p>

<p>Presently he stopped under a somewhat
dark archway, and threw away his cigarette.</p>

<p>"No," he said, after carefully watching
for some time the cabs and carriages which
passed; "nothing more to be seen of our
friend. I wonder what's up! It's Tempest
he was after, not me."</p>

<span class="hide">A</span> HAPPY childhood is one of the best
gifts that parents have it in their
power to bestow; second only to implanting
the habit of obedience, which puts the child
in training for the habit of obeying himself
later on.</p>

<p>A happy childhood is like a welcome into
the world. This welcome John never had.
No one had been glad to see him when
he arrived. No little ring of downy hair
had been cut off and treasured. No one
came to look at him when he was asleep.
No wedded hands were clasped the closer<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
for his coming. The love and awe and
pride which sometimes meet over the cradle
of a first child were absent from his nursery.
The old nurse who had been his mother's
nurse took him and loved him, and gave
herself for him, as is the marvellous way of
some women with other people's children.
I believe the under-housemaid occasionally
came to see him in his bath, and I think the
butler, who was a family man himself, gave
him a woolly lamb on his first birthday.
But excepting the servants and the village
people, no one took much notice of John.
It is not even on record whether he ever
crept, or what the first word he could say
was. It was all chronicled on Mitty's faithful
heart, but nowhere else. Mitty was
proud when he began to sway and reel on
unsteady legs. Mitty walked up and down
with him in her arms night after night when
teeth were coming, crooning little sympathetic<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
songs. Mitty dressed him every afternoon
in his best frock with blue sash and
ribboned socks, just like the other children
who go downstairs. But John never went
downstairs at teatime; never gnawed a lump
of sugar with solemn glutinous joy under a
parent's eye; or sucked the stiffness out of
a rusk before admiring friends. No one
sent for John; he was never wanted.</p>

<p>Mitty had had troubles. She had buried
Mr. Mitty many years ago, and, after keeping
a cow of her own, had returned to the
service of the Fanes, with whom she had
lived before her marriage. But I do not
think she ever felt anything so acutely as
the neglect of her "lamb."</p>

<p>When Mr. Tempest was expected home
John was put through tearful and elaborate
toilets. His hair, dark and straight, the
despair of Mitty's heart, was worked up
till it rose like a crest on the top of his<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
head; his bronze shoes (which succeeded
the knitted socks) were put on. But after
these great efforts Mitty always cried bitterly,
and kissed John till he cried too for
company, and then his smart things would
be torn off, and they would go down to tea
together in the housekeeper's room. That
was a treat. There was society in the
housekeeper's room. Mrs. Alcock was very
large, spread over with black silk which had
a rich aroma of desserts and sweet biscuits.
There were in her keeping certain macaroons
John knew of, for she was a person
of vast responsibilities. He sat on her knee
sometimes, but not often, for she breathed
and rose and fell all over, and creaked underneath
her buttons. She was kind, but
she was billowy, and the geography of her
figure was uncertain, and she could never
think of anything to interest him but
macaroons, and she was enigmatical as to<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
how the almond was fastened into the top.
The butler, Mr. Parker, was estimable, but
Mr. Parker, like Mrs. Alcock, was averse to
answering questions, even when John inquired,
"Why his head was coming through
his hair?" Charles the footman was more
amusing, but he never came into the housekeeper's
room. It was difficult to see as
much of Charles as could be wished. He
was really funny when Mitty was not there.
He could dance a hornpipe in the pantry.
John had seen him do it; and Charles was
always ready to pull off his coat and give
John a ride. What kickings and neighings
and prancings there were going upstairs on
these occasions. How John clutched round
his horse's neck urging him not to spare
himself, till he pressed his charger's shirtstud
into his throat. Once on a wet day
they went out hunting in the garret gallery,
but only once, when Mitty was out: and the<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
housemaid with the red cheeks was the fox.
Ah! what an afternoon that was. But it
came to an end all too soon. Charles wiped
his forehead at last, and said the fox was
"gone to ground," though John knew she
was only in the housemaid's closet, giggling
among the brooms. That was an afternoon
not to be forgotten, not even to be spoilt
by the fact that when Mitty and a bag of
bull's-eyes came home she was very angry,
and called the fox an "impudent hussy."
Perhaps that event was the first that remained
distinctly in his memory. Certainly
afterwards people and incidents detached
themselves more clearly from the haze of
confused memories that preceded it.</p>

<p>The following day as it seemed to John&mdash;perhaps,
in reality many weeks later&mdash;he had
a vague recollection of a stir in the house,
and of seeing various kinds of candles laid
out on a table near the storeroom; and then<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
he was in a new black velvet suit with a
collar that tickled, and they were in the
picture-gallery, he and Mitty, and there were
lamps, and all the white sheets were gone
from the furniture, and it was all very
solemn; and Mitty held his hand tight and
told him to be a good boy, and blew his
nose for him with a handkerchief of her own
that had crumbs in it, and then wiped her
eyes and gave him a flower to hold, telling
him to be very careful of it; and John was
<i>very</i> careful. Years later he could see that
flower still. It was a white orchis with
maidenhair; and then suddenly a door at the
further end of the gallery opened, and a tall
man, whom John had seen before, came out.</p>

<p>Mitty loosed John's hand and gave him a
little push, whispering, "Go and speak to
your papa, and give him the pretty flower."
But John stood stock still and looked at the
advancing figure.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[176]</span></p>

<p>And the tall gentleman came down the
gallery, and stopped short rather suddenly
when he saw them, and said, "Well, nurse,
all flourishing, I hope? Well, John," and
passed on.</p>

<p>And Mitty and John were much depressed,
and went upstairs again the back way; and
Mrs. Alcock met them at the swing door and
said <i>she never did</i>, and Mitty cried all the
time she undressed him, and he pulled the
orchis to pieces, and found on investigation
that it had wire inside; and experienced the
same difficulty in putting it together again
next morning that he had previously found in
readjusting the toilet of a dead robin after he
had carefully undressed it the night before.
After that "Papa" became not a familiar
but a distinct figure in John's recollection.
"Papa" was seen from the nursery windows
to walk up and down the bowling-green on
the wide plateau in front of the castle, where<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
the fountain was, with Neptune reining in his
dolphins in the middle. John was taught by
Mitty to kiss his hand to papa, but papa, who
seldom looked up, was apparently unconscious
of these blandishments. He was seen
to arrive and to depart. Sometimes other
men came back with him who met John in
the gardens and made delightful jokes, and
were almost equal to Charles, only they did
not wear livery.</p>

<p>One event followed close upon another.</p>

<p>A lady came to Overleigh. Mitty and
Mrs. Alcock agreed that no lady had ever
stayed at Overleigh since&mdash;and then they
stopped: and that very evening John was
actually sent for to come down to dessert.
Charles, who had run up to the nursery
during dinner to say so, remarked with a
prefatory "Lawks" that wonders would
never cease. John was quite ready at the
time the message came, sitting in his black<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
velvet suit and his silk stockings and his
buckled shoes in his own chair by the fire.
He had grown out of several suits whilst he
waited. It was one of the many inexplicable
things that he took in wondering silence at
the time, that when he wore those particular
garments a certain red cushion was always
put on the seat of his little cane-bottomed
chair. Mitty told him when he inquired
into it that was because of the pattern
coming off on his velvets, "blesh" him, and
John did not understand, but turned it over
in his mind together with everything he
heard, and pondered long beside the nursery
fire over many things, and was a very solemn,
richly-dressed, lonely little boy.</p>

<p>He had always been ready, always waiting
when Mr. Tempest was at home. Now at
last he was sent for. He took it with a stoic
calm. Mitty and Charles were much more
excited than he was. Even Mrs. Alcock,<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
who had seen too much of the ways of
scullery and dairymaids to be capable of
being surprised at anything in this world&mdash;even
she was taken aback. Mitty and he
went together down the grand staircase;
and the carved figures on the banisters had
lamps in their hands, so many lamps that
they made him wink, and in the great stone
hall there was a blazing log fire, and among
the statues there were tall palms and growing
things.</p>

<p>John was still looking at the white fur
rugs upon the stone floor, and counting the
claws of the outstretched bear's paws when
Charles came to tell them that dinner was
over. The moment had come. Mitty took
him to the door, opened it, and pushed him
gently in.</p>

<p>The dining-hall looked very large and
very empty. John had never been in it at
night before. A long way off at a little<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
table in the bay window two people were
sitting. A glow of shaded light fell on the
table. Mr. Parker was not there. Even
Charles, whom John had always considered
indispensable in the highest circles, was
absent. John walked very slowly across the
room and stopped short in the middle, his
strong little hands tightly clasped behind
his back on the clean folded pocket handkerchief
that Mitty had thrust into them at
the last moment. He was not afraid, but
he did not know what was going to happen
next.</p>

<p>The lady turned and looked towards him.</p>

<p>She was pale, with white hair, and a sad,
beautiful face as if she had often been very,
very sorry. She was older than Mitty and
Mrs. Alcock, and Mrs. Evans of the shop,
and quite different, very awful to look
upon.</p>

<p>John wondered whether she was Queen<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
Victoria, and whether he ought to kneel
down.</p>

<p>"Come here, John," said Mr. Tempest,
but John did not stir.</p>

<p>"So this is John," said the lady, and she
put out her wonderful jewelled hand with a
very gentle smile, and John went straight
up to her at once and stood close beside her,
on her gown, in fact; and it was not Queen
Victoria. It was Mrs. Courtenay.</p>

<p>After that night a change came over
John's life. He was not forgotten any more.
Mrs. Courtenay during the few days that
she remained at Overleigh came up several
times to the nursery, and had long conversations
with Mitty. John, arrayed in
the stiffest of white sailor suits with
anchors at the corners, came down to see
her in the sunny morning-room where his
mother's picture hung, and showed her at
her request his Noah's Ark which Mitty<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
had given him, and afterwards conversed
with her on many topics. He repeated to
her the hymn Mitty had taught him,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When little Samiwell awoke,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and mentioned Charles to her with high
esteem. She was very gentle with him,
very courteous. She gave him her whole
attention, looking at him with a certain
pained compassion. Gradually John unfolded
his mind to her. He confided to
her his intention of marrying Mitty at a
future date, and of presenting Charles at
the same time with a set of studs like Mr.
Parker's. He was very grave and sedate,
and every morning shrank back afresh from
going to see her, and then forgot his fears
in the kind feminine presence and the
welcome that was so new and strange and
sweet. Once she took him in her arms and
held him closely to her. Her eyes were
stern through her tears.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>"Poor little fatherless, motherless child!"
she said, half to herself, and she put him
down and went to the window and looked
out&mdash;looked out across the forest to the
valley and over the stretching woods to the
long lines of the moors against the sky.
Perhaps she was thinking that it would all
belong to that little child some day; the
home where she had once hoped to see her
own daughter live happily with children
growing up about her.</p>

<p>Mr. Tempest came into the room at that
moment.</p>

<p>"What, John here?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, and was silent. There
was a great indignation in her face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tempest," she said at last, "evil
has been done to you, not once, but twice.
You have suffered heavily at the hands of
others. Be careful that some one does not
suffer at <i>your</i> hands!"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[184]</span></p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Your," Mrs. Courtenay hesitated, "your
<i>heir</i>."</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> my heir," said Mr. Tempest,
sternly; "that is enough!"</p>

<p>"Then do your duty by him," said Mrs.
Courtenay. "You do it to others; do it
also to him." And thenceforward, and until
the day of his death, Mr. Tempest did his
duty as he conceived it! never a fraction
more, but never a fraction less.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>John was put early to school. No one
went down to see the place before he came
to it. No one wrote anxiously about him
beforehand, describing his health and his
attainments in the Latin grammar. Mr.
Goodwin, who was afterwards his tutor,
long remembered the arrival of the little,
square, bullet-headed boy with a servant,
with whom he gravely shook hands on the<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
platform. Mr. Goodwin had come to meet
him, and Charles, the last link to home, was
parted from in silence. The small luggage
was handed over. Once as they left the
station, John looked back, and Mr. Goodwin
saw the little brown hands clench tightly.
John had a trick of clenching his hands as
a child, which clung to him throughout life,
but he walked on in silence. He was seven
years old, and in trousers. <i>Pantalon oblige.</i>
Mr. Goodwin, a good-natured under-master
fresh from college, with small brothers at
home, respected his silence. Perhaps he
divined something of the struggle that was
going on under that brand new little great-coat
of many pockets. Presently John
swallowed ominously several times.</p>

<p>Mr. Goodwin supposed the usual tears
were coming.</p>

<p>"Those are very large puddles," said
John suddenly, with a quaver in his voice,<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
"larger than&mdash;&mdash;" The voice, though not
the courage, failed.</p>

<p>"They are, Tempest," said Mr. Goodwin,
"uncommonly large!"</p>

<p>And that was the beginning of a lasting
friendship between the two. That friendship
took a long time to grow. John was
reserved with the reticence that in a child
speaks volumes of what the home-life had
been. He had not the habit of talking to
anyone. He listened and obeyed. At first
he held aloof from the other boys. Mr.
Goodwin advised him to make friends, and
John listened in silence. He had never
been with boys before. He did not know
how. The first half he was very lonely.
He would have been bullied more than he
actually was had he not been so strong and
so impossible to convince of defeat. As
it was, he took his share with a sort of
doggedness, and would have started on the<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
high road to unpopularity in his new little
world if he had not turned out good at
games. That saved him, and before many
weeks were over long blotted accounts of
football and cricket and racquets were
written to Mitty and Charles. Mr. Goodwin
noticed that the weekly letter to his father
never contained any particulars of this kind.</p>

<p>There had been a difficulty at first about
his correspondence, which&mdash;after long
pondering upon the same&mdash;John had
brought to Mr. Goodwin for advice.</p>

<p>"I want to send a letter to some one,"
he said one day, when Mr. Goodwin had
asked him into his study. "Not father."</p>

<p>"To whom, then?"</p>

<p>"To Mitty. I said I would write; I
promised." And he produced a very much
blotted paper and spread it before Mr.
Goodwin.</p>

<p>"It's a long letter." It was indeed; the<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
writing had been so severe and the paper
so thin, that it had worked through to the
other side.</p>

<p>"For Mitty," said John. "That is the
person it's for; and another for Charles,
with a picture in it." And a second sheet,
suggestive of severe manual labour, was
produced.</p>

<p>"I see," said Mr. Goodwin, his hand laid
carelessly over his mouth, "but&mdash;yes, I see.
This for Charles, and this for&mdash;ahem!&mdash;Mitty.
And you want them to go to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes." John was evidently relieved. He
extracted from his trousers pocket two envelopes,
not much the worse for seclusion,
and laid one by each letter. One envelope
was stamped. "I had two stamps," he explained;
"one I put on, and the other I ate
in a mistake. I licked it, and then I could
not find it."</p>

<p>"Well, we will put on another," said Mr.<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
Goodwin, who was a person of resources.
"Now, what next? Shall we put them into
their envelopes?"</p>

<p>John cautiously assented.</p>

<p>"And perhaps you would like me to direct
them for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes." John certainly had a nice smile.</p>

<p>"Well, here goes; we will do Charles
first. Who is Charles?"</p>

<p>"He lives with us. He brought me in
the train."</p>

<p>"Really! Well, what is his name?
Charles what?"</p>

<p>"He is not Charles anything," said John,
anxiously. "That's just it; he's only
Charles."</p>

<p>Mr. Goodwin laid down the pen. He
saw the difficulty.</p>

<p>"He must have another name, Tempest,"
he said. "Try and think."</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> thought," said John. "Before I<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
came to you I thought. I thought in bed
last night."</p>

<p>"And don't you know Mitty's name
either?"</p>

<p>"No." John's voice was almost inaudible.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Goodwin, smiling,
and not realizing the gravity of the situation.
"We can't put 'Mitty' on one letter, and
'Charles' on the other. That would never
do, would it?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, in which
hope went straight out of John's heart. If
Mr. Goodwin could not see his way out of
the difficulty, who could? He turned red,
and then white. His harsh-featured, little
face took an ugly look of acute distress.</p>

<p>"I said I would write," he said, in a
strangled voice. "I promised Charles in
the pantry; it was a faithful promise."</p>

<p>Mr. Goodwin looked up in surprise, and
his manner changed.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[191]</span></p>

<p>"Wait a minute," he said, eagerly; "the
letters shall go. We will manage it somehow.
Is Charles the butler at home?"</p>

<p>"No; that is Mr. Parker."</p>

<p>"What is he, then?"</p>

<p>"He does things for Mr. Parker. Mr.
Parker points, and Charles hands the plates."</p>

<p>"Footman, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said John, with relief, "that's
Charles."</p>

<p>"Now," said Mr. Goodwin, with interest,
"shall we put, 'The footman, Overleigh
Castle,' on the envelope? Then it will be
sure to reach him."</p>

<p>"There's Francis; he's a footman, too,"
suggested John, but with dawning hope.
"Francis might get it then. He took a
kidney once!"</p>

<p>"We will put 'Charles, the footman,' then,"
said Mr. Goodwin, writing it. "'Overleigh
Castle,' Yorkshire. Now then, for the other."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[192]</span></p>

<p>"When I write to father, what do I put
at the end?" said John, his eyes still riveted
on the envelope. "'J. Tempest,' and then
something else."</p>

<p>"Esquire?" suggested Mr. Goodwin.</p>

<p>"Yes," said John. "I think I should like
Charles to be the same as father, please."</p>

<p>Mr. Goodwin added a large esquire after
the word footman.</p>

<p>"Now for Mitty," he said. "I suppose
Mitty is the housekeeper?"</p>

<p>"Why, the housekeeper is Mrs. Alcock!"
said John, with a smile at Mr. Goodwin's
ignorance.</p>

<p>"There seem to be a good many servants
at Overleigh."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied John, "it is a nice party.
We are company to each other. You see,
father is always away almost, and he does
not play anything when he is at home.
Now, Charles always does his concertina in<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
the evenings, and Francis is learning the
flute."</p>

<p>After the direction of the second letter
had been finally settled, John licked them
carefully up, and looked at them with
triumph.</p>

<p>"You must go now," said Mr. Goodwin.
"I'm busy."</p>

<p>John retreated to the door, and then
paused.</p>

<p>"Me and Mitty and Charles are much
obliged," he said, with dignity.</p>

<p>"Don't mention it," said Mr. Goodwin.</p>

<p>But the incident remained in his mind.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/drop_j.jpg" width="80" height="82" alt="J" />
<span class="hide">J</span>OHN was eleven years old when, during
a memorable Easter holidays, his father
died, and lay in state in the round room in
the western tower, and was buried at midnight
by torchlight in the little Norman
church at Overleigh, as had been the custom
of the Tempests from time immemorial.</p>

<p>His father's death made very little difference
to John, except that his holidays were
spent with Miss Fane, an aunt in London:
and Charles left to become a butler with a
footman under him; and the other servants,<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
too, seemed to melt away, leaving only Mitty,
and Mr. Parker, and Mrs. Alcock, in the old
shuttered home. Mr. Goodwin was John's
tutor during the holidays. It was he who
saved John's life at the railway station, at the
risk of his own.</p>

<p>No one had been aware, till the accident
happened, that John had been particularly
attached to his tutor. He evidently got on
with him, and was conveniently pleased with
his society, but he had, to a peculiar degree,
the stolid indifferent manner of most schoolboys.
He was absolutely undemonstrative,
and he tacitly resented his aunt's occasional
demonstrative affection to himself. When
will unmarried elder people learn that children
are not to be deceived? John was very
courteous, even as a boy, but his best friends
could not say of him, at that or at any later
period of his life, that he was engaging.
He had, through life, a cold manner. No<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
one had supposed, what really was the case,
namely, that he would have given his body
to be burned for the sake of the kind, cheerful
young man who had taken an easy fancy
to him on his arrival at school, and had
subsequently become sufficiently fond of him
to prefer being his tutor to that of any one
else. He guessed John's absolute devotion
to himself as little as any one. John's boyish
thoughts, and feelings, and affections, were of
that shy yet fierce kind, which shrink equally
from expression and detection. No one had
so far found them hard to deal with, because
no one had thought of dealing with them.</p>

<p>Yet John sat for two days on the stairs
outside the sick man's room, after the accident,
unnoticed and unreprimanded. He was
never seen to cry, but he was, nevertheless,
almost unable to see out of his eyes. His
aunt, Miss Fane, at whose house in London
he was spending his Christmas holidays, had<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
gone down to the country to nurse a sister,
and the house was empty, but for the servants
and the trained nurse. The doctor, who
came several times a day, always found him
sitting on the stairs, or appearing stealthily
from an upper landing, working himself down
by the balusters. He said very little, but
the doctor seemed to understand the situation,
and always had a kind and encouraging
word for him, and gave him Mr. Goodwin's
love, and took messages and offers of his
best books from John to the invalid. But
during those two long days, he always had
some excellent reason for John's not visiting
his tutor. He was invariably, at that moment,
tired, or asleep, or resting, or&mdash;&mdash; A deep
anxiety settled on John's mind. Something
was being kept from him.</p>

<p>Christmas Day came and passed. Mitty's
present, and a Christmas card from a
friend, the Latin master's youngest daughter,<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
came for John, but they were unopened.
The next day brought three doctors who
stayed a long time in the drawing-room after
they had been in the sick-room.</p>

<p>John sat on the stairs with clenched hands.
At last he got up deliberately and went into
the drawing-room. Two of the doctors were
sitting down. One was standing on the
hearth-rug looking into the fire.</p>

<p>"It can't be done," he was saying emphatically.
"Both must go."</p>

<p>All three men turned in surprise as John
entered the room. He came up to the fire,
unaware of the enormity of the crime he was
committing in interrupting a consultation.
He tried to speak. He had got ready what
he wished to ask. But his lips only moved;
no words came out.</p>

<p>The consultation was evidently finished,
for the man on the hearth-rug, who seemed
anxious to get away, was buttoning his fur<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
coat, and holding his hands to the fire for a
last warm. They were very kind. They
were not jocose with him, as is the horrible
way of some elder persons with childhood's
troubles. The old doctor who came daily
put his hand on his shoulder and told him
Mr. Goodwin had been very ill, but that he
was going to get better, going to be quite
well and strong again presently.</p>

<p>John said nothing. He was convinced
there was something in the background.</p>

<p>"Twelve o'clock to-morrow, then," said
the man who was in a hurry, and he took up
his hat and went out.</p>

<p>"I have two boys about the same age
as you," said the old doctor, patting John's
shoulder. "Tom and Edward. They are
making a little model steam-engine. I expect
you are fond of engines, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Not just now, thank you," said John.
"I am sometimes."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[200]</span></p>

<p>"I wish you would come and see it
to-morrow," continued the doctor. "They
would like to show it you, I know. I could
send you back in the carriage when it has
set me down here about&mdash;shall we say
twelve? Do come and see it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said John almost inaudibly,
"you are very kind, but&mdash;I am engaged."</p>

<p>Miss Fane always said she was engaged
when she did not want to accept an invitation,
and John supposed it was a polite way
of saying he would rather not go. The
other doctor laughed, but not unkindly, and
the father of Tom and Edward absently
drew on his gloves, as if turning over something
in his mind.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the new lion, and the
birds that fly under water at the Zoo?" he
inquired slowly, "and the snakes being fed?"</p>

<p>"No," said John.</p>

<p>"Ah! That's the thing to see," he said<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
thoughtfully. "Tom and Edward have been.
Dear me! How they enjoyed it! They
went at feeding time, mid-day. And my
nephew, Harry Austin, who is twenty-one
and at college, went with them, and said he
would not have missed it for anything. You
go and see that, with that nice man who
answers the bell. I will send you two tickets
to-night."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said John.</p>

<p>The two doctors shook hands with him
and departed.</p>

<p>"You may as well keep your tickets," said
the younger one as they went downstairs.
"He does not mean going."</p>

<p>"He is a queer little devil," said Tom's and
Edward's father. "But I like him. There's
grit in him, and he watches outside that
room like a dog. I wish I could have got
him out of the house to-morrow, poor little
beggar."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>John stood quite still in the middle of the
long, empty drawing-room when they were
gone. A nameless foreboding of some
horrible calamity was upon him. And yet&mdash;and
yet&mdash;they had said he was going to get
better, to be quite strong again. He waylaid
the trained nurse for the twentieth time,
and she said the same.</p>

<p>He suffered himself to be taken out for
a walk, after hearing from her that Mr.
Goodwin wished it; and in the afternoon he
consented to go with George, Miss Fane's
cheerful, good-natured young footman, to
the "Christian Minstrels." But he lay
awake all night, and in the morning after
breakfast he crept noiselessly back to the
stairs. It was a foggy morning, and the gas
was lit. Jessie, the stout, silly housemaid,
always in a perspiration or tears, was sweeping
the landing just above him, sniffing audibly
as she did so.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>"Poor young gentleman," she was saying
below her breath to her colleague. "I can't
a-bear the thought of the operation. It
seems to turn my inside clean upside down."</p>

<p>John clutched hold of the banisters. His
heart gave one throb, and then stood quite
still.</p>

<p>"Coleman says as both 'is 'ands must go,"
said the other maid also in a whisper. "She
told me herself. She says she's never seen
such a case all her born days. They've
been trying all along to save one, but they
can't. They're to be took hoff to-day."</p>

<p>John understood at last.</p>

<p>He slipped downstairs again, and stood
a moment in hesitation where to go: not
to the little back-room on the ground-floor,
which had been set apart for his use by his
aunt. He might be found there. George
might come in to see if he would fancy a
game of battledore and shuttle-cock, or the<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
cook might step up with a little cake, or the
butler himself might bring him a comic
paper. The servants were always kind.
But he felt that he could not bear any
kindness just now. He must be somewhere
alone by himself.</p>

<p>The drawing-room door was locked, but
the key was on the outside. He turned it
cautiously and went in. The room was
dark and fiercely cold. Bands of yellow fog
peered in over the tops of the shutters. The
room had been prepared the day before for
the consultation, but now it had returned to
its former shuttered, muffled state. John
took the key from the outside and locked
himself in.</p>

<p>Then he flung himself on his face on to
one of the muffled settees and stuffed the
dust-sheet into his mouth. Anything not to
scream&mdash;a low strangled cry was wrenched
out of him; another and another, and<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
another, but the dust sheet told no tales.
He dragged it down with him on to the
floor and bit into the wet, cobwebby material.
And by degrees the paroxysm passed.
The power to keep silence returned. At
last John sat up and looked round him,
breathing hard. A clock ticked in the
darkness, and presently struck a single
chime. Half-past something&mdash;half-past
eleven it must be&mdash;and they were coming
at twelve.</p>

<p>Was there no help?</p>

<p>"God," said John suddenly, in a low,
distinct voice in the darkness. "Do something.
If you don't stop it nobody else will.
You know you can if you like. You divided
the Red Sea. Remember all your plagues.
Oh, God! God! make something happen.
There's half an hour still. Think of him.
Both hands. And all the clever books he
was going to write, and all the things he<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
was going to do. Oh, God! God! and <i>such</i>
a cricketer!"</p>

<p>There was a short silence. John felt
absolutely certain God would answer. He
waited a long time, but no one spoke. The
fog deepened outside. The quarter struck
faintly from the church in the next street.</p>

<p>"I give up one hand," said John, stretching
out both of his. "I only ask for one
now. Let him keep one&mdash;the other one.
He is so clever, he could soon learn to write
with his left, and perhaps hooks don't hurt
after the first. Oh, God! I dare say he
could manage with one, but not both, not
both."</p>

<p>John repeated the last words over and
over again in an agony of supplication. He
would <i>make</i> God hear.</p>

<p>It was growing very dark. The link-boys
were crying in the streets: a carriage stopped
at the door.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[207]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, God! They're coming. Not both;
not both!" gasped John, and the sweat
broke from his forehead.</p>

<p>Two more carriages&mdash;lowered voices in
the passage, and quiet footfalls going upstairs.
John prayed without ceasing. The
house had become very silent. At last the
silence awed him, and an overmastering
longing to know seized upon him. He stole
out of the drawing-room, and sped swiftly
upstairs. On the landing opposite Mr.
Goodwin's room the butler was standing
listening. Everything was quite still. John
could hear the gas burning. There was a
can of hot water just outside the door.
The steam curled upwards out of the
spout. As he reached the landing the
door was softly opened, and the nurse
raised the heavy can and lifted it into the
room.</p>

<p>Through the open door came a hoarse<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
inarticulate sound, which seemed to pierce
into John's brain.</p>

<p>"Courage," said a gentle voice, and the
door was closed again. The butler breathed
heavily, and there was a whimper from the
upper landing. Trembling from head to
foot John fled down the stairs again unperceived
into the drawing-room, and crouched
down on the floor near the open door, turning
his face to the wall. Every now and
then a strong shudder passed over him, and
he beat his little black head dumbly against
the wall. But he did not move until at last
the doctors came down. He let the first
two pass, he could not speak to them; and
it was a long time before the father of Tom
and Edward appeared. John came suddenly
out upon him at the turn of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Is it both?" he said, clutching his coat.</p>

<p>"Both what, my boy?" said the doctor,
puzzled by the sudden onslaught, and looking<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
down at the blackened convulsed face
and shaggy hair.</p>

<p>"Both <i>hands</i>."</p>

<p>The doctor hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said gravely. "I am grieved
to say it is." John flung up his arms.</p>

<p>"I will never pray to God again as long
as I live," he said passionately.</p>

<p>"John," said the doctor sternly, and then
suddenly putting out his hand to catch him
as he reeled backwards. "What? Good
gracious! The child has fainted."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>John went back to school before the
holidays were over, for Miss Fane on her
return found it difficult to know what to do
with him. Mr. Goodwin came back no more.
He slowly regained a certain degree of
health, a ruined man, without private means,
at seven and twenty. John wrote constantly
to him, and wrote also long urgent letters<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
in a large cramped hand to his trustees.
And something inadequate was done. When
he came of age his first action was to alter
that something, and to induce Mr. Goodwin
and the sister who lived with him to take
up their abode in the chaplain's house, in
the park at Overleigh, where they had
now been established nearly seven years.
Whether John's was an affectionate nature
or not it would be hard to say, for affection
had so far intermeddled little with his life;
but he had a kind of faithfulness, and a
memory of the heart as well as of the head.
John never forgot a kindness, never wholly
forgot an injury. He might forgive one,
for he showed as he grew towards man's
estate, and passed through the various
vicissitudes of school and college life, a
certain stern generosity of temper, and
contempt for small retaliations. He was
certainly not revengeful, but&mdash;he remembered.<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
His mind was as tenacious of impression as
engraved steel. That very tenacity of impression
had given Mr. Goodwin an unbounded
influence over him in his early
youth. John had believed absolutely in Mr.
Goodwin; and Mr. Goodwin, hurried by a
bitter short cut of suffering from youth to
responsible middle age, had devoted himself
with the religious fervour of entire self-abnegation
to the boy for whom he had
risked his life. John's intense attachment
to him had after his recovery come as a
surprise to him, yoked with a sense of responsibility;
for to be loved in any fashion
is to incur a great responsibility.</p>

<p>Mr. Goodwin acted according to his lights.
But the good intentions of others cannot
pave the way to heaven for us. In the
manner of many well-meaning teachers, Mr.
Goodwin used his influence over John to
impress upon him the stamp of his own<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
narrow religious convictions. He honestly
believed it was the best thing he could do for
the young, strong, earnest nature which sat
at his feet. But John did not sit long. Mr.
Goodwin was aghast at the way in which
the little chains and check-strings of his
scheme of salvation were snapped like
thread when John began to rise to his feet.
An influence misused, if once shaken, is lost
for ever. John went away like a young
Samson, taking the poor weaver's inadequate
beam with him; and never came back.
Mr. Goodwin's teaching had done its work.
John never leaned again "on one mind overmuch."
Mr. Goodwin pushed him early
into scepticism, into which narrow teaching
pushes all independent natures, and regarded
his success with bitter disappointment. John
left him, and Mr. Goodwin's office others
took. Mr. Goodwin suffered horribly.</p>

<p>John had not, of course, reached seven<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
and twenty without passing through many
phases, each more painful to Mr. Goodwin
than the last. He had spoken fiercely at
Oxford on one occasion in favour of community
of goods, to the surprise and amusement
of his friends; and on one other single
occasion in support of the philosophy of
Kant, with which he did not agree, but
whose side he could not bear to see inefficiently
taken up only for the sake of refutation.
When the spirit moved him John
could be suddenly eloquent, but the spirit
very seldom did. As a rule he saw both
sides with equal clearness, and could be
forced into partisanship on neither. Those
who expected he would make a brilliant
speaker in the House of Commons would
probably be disappointed in him. It was
remarkable, considering he had apparently
no special talent or aptitude for any one
line of study, and had never particularly<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
distinguished himself either at school or
college, that nevertheless he had unconsciously
raised in the minds of those who
knew him best, and many who knew him
not at all, a more or less vague expectation
that he would make his mark, that in some
fashion or other he would come to the fore.</p>

<p>The abilities of persons with square jaws
are usually taken for granted by the crowd,
and certainly John's was square enough
to suggest any amount of reserved force.
But general expectation rarely falls on
those who have sufficient strength not only
to resist its baneful influence, but also to
realize its hopes. The effect of the expectation
of others on many minds is to draw into
greater activity that personal conceit which,
once indulged, saps the roots of individual
life, and gradually vitiates the powers. Conceit
is only mediocrity in the bud. Like a
blight in Spring it stunts the autumn fruit.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[215]</span></p>

<p>On some natures again the expectation of
others acts as a stimulus, the force of which
is quite incalculable. It spurs a natural
humility into fixed resolution and self-reliance;
turns sloth into energy, earnestness
into action, and goads diffidence up the hill
of achievement. It has been truly said, that
"those who trust us educate us." Perhaps
it might be added that those who believe in
us make or destroy us.</p>

<p>If John, who was perfectly aware of the
enthusiastic or grudging expectations that
others had formed of him, had not as yet
fallen into either of these two extremes, it
was probably because what others might
happen to think or not think concerning
him was of little moment to him, and had
no power to sway him either way.</p>

<p>The thing of all others that puzzled John's
staunchest adherents was their inability to
fix him in any one set of opinions, social,<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
political, or religious. Many after Mr. Goodwin
tried and failed. For John's great
wealth and position, besides the native force
of character of which even as a very young
man he gave signs, and an openness of mind
which encouraged while it ought to have disheartened
proselytism, all these attributes
had made him an object of interest and
importance, which would have ruined a more
self-conscious man. As it was, he listened,
got to the bottom of the subject, whatever it
might be, never left it till he had probed it
to the uttermost, and then went his way.
He marched out of every mental prison he
could be temporarily lured into. He would
go boldly into any that interested him,
but locks and bars would not hold him
directly he did not wish to stay there any
longer.</p>

<p>Mr. Goodwin hoped against hope that
John would see the error of his ways, and<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
"come back"; that, according to his mode
of expressing himself, the pride of the intellect
might be broken, and John might one
day be moved to return from the desert and
husks and the sw&mdash;&mdash; philosophy of free
thought to his father's home. He said something
of the kind one day to John, and was
astonished at the sudden flame that leapt
into the young man's eyes as he silently took
up his hat and went out.</p>

<p>The one thing of all others which the Mr.
Goodwins of this world are incapable of
discerning, is that to leave an outgrown form
of faith is in itself an act of faith almost
beyond the strength of shrinking human
frailty. To bury a dead belief is hard. They
regard it invariably as a voluntary desertion,
not of their form of religion, but of religion
itself for private ends, or from a sense of
irksomeness. Mr. Goodwin had reproachfully
suggested that John had got into "a<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
bad set" at Oxford, and was in the habit of
mixing in "doubtful society" in London.
Those whose surroundings have moulded
them attribute all mental changes in others
to a superficial and generally an entirely
inadequate influence such as would have had
power to affect themselves.</p>

<p>John left the house white with anger. He
had been anxious and humble half an hour
before. He had listened sadly enough to
Mr. Goodwin's counsels, the old, old counsels
that fortunately always come too late&mdash;that
are worse than none, because they appeal to
motives of self-interest, safety, peace of mind,
etc.; the pharisaical reasoning that what has
been good enough for our fathers is good
enough for us.</p>

<p>But now his anger was fierce against
his teacher, who was so quick to believe
evil of any development not of his own
fostering.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[219]</span></p>

<p>"He calls good evil, and evil good," he
said to himself. "It seems to me I have
only got to lose hold of the best in me, and
lead a cheap goody-goody sort of life, and
I should please everybody all round, Mr.
Goodwin included. He wants me to remain
a child always. He would break my mind
to pieces now if he could, and would offer
up the little bits to God. He thinks the
voice of God in the heart is a temptation of
the devil. I will not silence it and crush it
down, as he wants me to do. I will love,
honour, and cherish it from this day forward,
for better for worse, for richer for poorer,
in sickness and in health."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There seems to be in life a call which
comes to a few only who, like the young man
in the Gospel, have great possessions. From
youth up the life may have been carefully
lived in certain well-worn grooves traced by<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
the finger of God&mdash;grooves in which many
are allowed to pass their whole existence.
But to some among those many, to some
few with great mental possessions, the voice
comes sooner or later: "Forsake all, leave
all, and follow Me." How many turn away
sorrowful? They cannot believe in the
New Testament of the present day. They
ponder instead what God whispered eighteen
hundred years ago in the ear of a listening
Son, but they shrink from recognizing the
same voice speaking in their hearts now,
completing all that has gone before. And
so the point of life is missed. The individual
life, namely, the life of Christ&mdash;obedient not
to Scripture, but to the Giver of the Scripture&mdash;is
not lived. The life Christ led&mdash;at
variance with the recognized faiths and
fashionable opinions of the day, at variance
just because it did not conform to a dead
ritual, just because it was obedient throughout<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
to a personal prompting&mdash;that life is not more
tolerated to-day than it was eighteen hundred
years ago. The Church will have none of
it&mdash;treats the first spark of it as an infidelity
to Christ Himself. Against every young
and ardent listening and questioning soul the
Church and the world combine, as in Our
Lord's day, to crucify once again the Christ&mdash;life
which is not of their kindling, which is
indeed an infidelity, but an infidelity only to
them. So the crucifix is raised high. The
sign of our great rejection of Him is deified;
the Mediator, the Saviour, the Redeemer is
honoured. The instrument of His death
is honoured; but the thought for the sake
of which He was content to stretch His
nailed hands upon it, His thought is without
honour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Poor Mr. Goodwin! Poor John! Affection
had to struggle on as best it could as<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
the years widened the gulf between them,
and was reduced to find a meagre subsistence
in cordial words and sympathy for neuralgia
on John's part, and interest in John's shooting
and hunting on Mr. Goodwin's. Affectionate
and easy terms were gradually re-established
between them, and a guarded sympathy on
general subjects returned; but Mr. Goodwin
knew that, from being "the friend of the
inner, he had become only the companion of
the outer life" of the person he cared for
most in the world, and the ways of Providence
appeared to him inscrutable. And now Mr.
Goodwin understood John even less at
seven and twenty than at twenty-one. The
conception of the possibility of a mind that
after being strongly influenced by a succession
of the most "dangerous" teachers and books,
gives final allegiance to none, and can at last
elect to stand alone, was impossible to Mr.
Goodwin. And yet John arrived at that<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
simple and natural result at which those
who have sincerely and humbly searched for
a law and an authority outside themselves
do arrive. An external authority is soon
seen to be too good to be true. There
is no court of appeal against the verdict
of the inexorable judge who dwells
within.</p>

<p>How many rush hither and thither and
wear down the patience of earnest counsellors,
and whittle away all the best years of their
lives to nothingness, in fretting and scratching
among ruins for the law by which they
may live! They look for it in Bibles, in the
minds of anxious friends who turn over
everything to help them, in the face of
Nature, who betrays the knowledge of the
secret in her eyes, but who utters it not.
And last of all a remnant of the many look
in their own hearts, where the great law of
life has been hidden from the beginning.<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
David says: "Yea, Thy law is within my
heart." A greater than David said the same.
But it is buried deep, and few there be that
find it.</p>

melted into the season, and Mrs.
Courtenay gave a little dinner-party, at
which John was one of the guests; and
Madeleine was presented on her marriage;
and Di had two new gowns, and renovated
an old one, and nearly broke Lord Hemsworth's
heart by refusing the box-seat on
his drag at the meeting of the Four-in-hand;
and Lord Hemsworth did not invest in the<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
bay mare with the white stocking, but turned
heaven and earth to find another with black
points, and succeeded, only to drive in lonely
bitterness to the meet. And John was to
have been there also, but he had been so
severely injured in a fire which broke out
at his lodgings, in the room below his, three
weeks before, that he was still lying helpless
at the house in Park Lane, which he had lent
to his aunt, Miss Fane, and whither he was
at once taken, after the accident, to struggle
slowly back to life and painful convalescence.</p>

<p>For the last three weeks, since the fire,
hardly any one had seen Colonel Tempest.
The old horror had laid hold upon him like
a mortal sickness. Sleep had left him. Remorse
looked at him out of the eyes of the
passers in the street. There was no refuge.
He avoided his club. What might he not
hear there! What might not have happened
in the night! He could trust himself to go<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
nowhere for fear of his face betraying him.
He wandered aimlessly out in the evenings
in the lonelier portions of the Park. Sometimes
he would stop his loitering, to follow
with momentary interest the children sailing
their boats on the Round Pond, and then
look up and see the veiled London sunset
watching him from behind Kensington
Palace, and turn away with a guilty sense
of detection. The aimless days and waking
ghosts of nights came and went, came and
went, until his misery became greater than
he could bear. The resolutions of the weak
are as much the result of the period of feeble,
apathetic inertia that precedes them, as the
resolutions of the strong are the outcome of
earnest reflection and mental travail.</p>

<p>"It will kill me if it goes on," he said to
himself. There was one way, and one only,
by means of which this intolerable weight
might be shifted from his shoulders. He<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
hung back many days. He said he could
not do <i>that</i>, anything but <i>that</i>&mdash;and then he
did it.</p>

<p>His heart beat painfully as he turned his
steps towards Park Lane, and he hesitated
many minutes before he mounted the steps
and rang the bell at the familiar door of the
Tempest town-house, where his father had
lived during the session, where his mother
had spent the last years of her life after his
death.</p>

<p>It was an old-fashioned house. The iron
rings into which the links used to be thrust
still flanked the ponderous doorway, together
with the massive extinguisher.</p>

<p>The servant informed him that Mr. Tempest
had been out of danger for some days,
but was not seeing any one at present.</p>

<p>"Ask if he will see me," said Colonel
Tempest, hoarsely. "Say I am waiting."</p>

<p>The man left him in the white stone hall<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
where he and his brother Jack had played
as boys. The dappled rocking-horse used
to stand under the staircase, but it was no
longer there: given away, no doubt, or
broken up for firewood. John might have
kept the poor old rocking-horse. Recollections
that took the form of personal grievances
were never far from Colonel Tempest's
mind.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the man returned, and
said that Mr. Tempest would see him, and
led the way upstairs. A solemn, melancholy-looking
valet was waiting for him, who
respectfully informed him that the doctor's
orders were that his master should be kept
very quiet, and should not be excited in any
way. Colonel Tempest nodded unheeding,
and was conscious of a door being opened,
and his name announced.</p>

<p>He went forward hesitatingly into a half-darkened
room.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[230]</span></p>

<p>"Pull up the further blind, Marshall," said
John's voice. The servant did so, and
noiselessly left the room.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest's heart smote him.</p>

<p>The young man lay quite motionless, his
dark head hardly raised, his swathed hands
stretched out beside him. His unshaved
face had the tension of protracted suffering,
and the grave steady eyes which met Colonel
Tempest's were bright with suppressed pain.
The eyes were the only things that moved.
It seemed to Colonel Tempest that if they
were closed&mdash;. He shuddered involuntarily.
In his morbid fancy the prostrate figure
seemed to have already taken the rigid lines
of death, the winding-sheet to be even now
drawn up round the young haggard face.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest was not gifted with
imagination where he himself was not concerned.
He was under the impression that
the influenza, from which he occasionally<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
suffered, was the most excruciating form of
mortal illness known to mankind. He never
believed people were really ill until they
were dead. Now he realized for the first
time that John had been at death's door;
that is to say, he realized what being at
death's door was like, and he was fairly
staggered!</p>

<p>"Good God, John!" he said with a sort
of groan. "I did not know it had been as
bad as this."</p>

<p>"Sit down," said John, as the nurse
brought forward a chair to the bedside, and
then withdrew, eyeing the new-comer suspiciously.
"It is much better now. I receive
callers. Hemsworth was here yesterday.
I can shake hands a little; only be very
gentle with me. I cry like a girl if I am
more than touched."</p>

<p>John feebly raised and held out a bandaged
hand, of which the end of three fingers only<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
were visible. Colonel Tempest, whose own
feelings were invariably too deep to admit
of his remembering those of others, pressed
it spasmodically in his.</p>

<p>"It goes to my heart to see you like
this, John," he said with a break in his voice.</p>

<p>John withdrew his hand. His face
twitched a little, and he bit his lip, but in
a few moments he spoke again firmly
enough.</p>

<p>"It is very good of you to come. Now
that I have got round the corner, I shall be
about again in no time."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Colonel Tempest, as if
reassuring himself. "You will be all right
again soon."</p>

<p>"You look knocked up," said John, considering
him attentively with his dark
earnest gaze.</p>

<p>"Do I?" said Colonel Tempest. "I dare
say I do. Yes, people may not notice it as<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
a rule. I keep things to myself, always have
done all my life, but&mdash;it will drag me into my
grave if it goes on much longer, I know that."</p>

<p>"If what goes on?"</p>

<p>It is all very well for a nervous rider to
look boldly at a hedge two fields away, but
when he comes up with it, and feels his
horse quicken his pace under him, he begins
to wonder what the landing on the invisible
other side will be like. There was a
long silence, broken only by Lindo, John's
Spanish poodle, who, ensconced in an armchair
by the bedside, was putting an aristocratic
and extended hind leg through an
afternoon toilet by means of searching and
sustained suction.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose there is a more wretched
man in the world than I am, John," said
Colonel Tempest at last.</p>

<p>"There is something on your mind,
perhaps."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[234]</span></p>

<p>"Night and day," said Colonel Tempest,
wishing John would not watch him so
closely. "I have not a moment's peace."</p>

<p>"You are in money difficulties," said John,
justly divining the only cause that was likely
to permanently interfere with his uncle's
peace of mind.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Colonel Tempest. "I am at
my wit's end, and that is the truth."</p>

<p>John's lips tightened a little, and he remained
silent. That was why his uncle had
come to see him then. His pride revolted
against Colonel Tempest's want of it, against
Archie's sponge-like absorption of all John
would give him. He felt (and it was no
idle fancy of a wealthy man) that he would
have died rather than have asked for a
shilling. A Tempest should be above
begging, should scorn to run in debt.
John's pride of race resented what was
in his eyes a want of honour in the other<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
members of the family of which he was the
head.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest was in a position of too
much delicacy not to feel hurt by John's
silence. He reflected on the invariable
meanness of rich men, with a momentary
retrospect of how open-handed he had been
himself in his youth, and even after his
crippling marriage.</p>

<p>"I do not know the circumstances," said
John at last.</p>

<p>"No one does," said Colonel Tempest.</p>

<p>"Neither have I any wish to know them,"
said John, with a touch of haughtiness,
"except in so far as I can be of use to you."</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest found himself very disagreeably
placed. He would have instantly
lost his temper if he had been a few weeks
younger, but the memory of those last few
weeks recurred to him like a douche of cold
water. Self-interest would not allow him<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
to throw away his last chance of escaping
out of Swayne's clutches, and he had a secret
conviction that no storming or passion of
any kind would have any effect on that
prostrate figure, with the stern feeble voice,
and intense fixity of gaze.</p>

<p>John had always felt a secret repulsion
towards his uncle, though he invariably met
him with grave, if distant civility. He had
borne in a proud silence the gradual realization,
as he grew old enough to understand
it, that there was a slur upon his name,
a shadow on his mother's memory. He
believed, as did some others, that his uncle
had originated the slanders, impossible to
substantiate, in order to wrest his inheritance
from him. How could this man,
after trying to strip him of everything,
even of his name, come to him now for
money?</p>

<p>John had a certain rigidity and tenacity<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
of mind, an uprightness and severity, which
come of an intense love of justice and rectitude,
but which in an extreme degree, if
not counterbalanced by other qualities, make
a hard and unlovable character.</p>

<p>His clear-eyed judgment made him look
at Colonel Tempest with secret indignation
and contempt. But with the harshness of
youth other qualities, rarely joined, went
hand in hand. A little knowledge of others
is a dangerous thing. It shows itself in
sweeping condemnations and severe judgments,
and a complacent holding up to the
light of the poor foibles and peccadilloes of
humanity, which all who will can find. A
greater knowledge shows itself in a greater
tenderness towards others, the tenderness,
as some suppose, of wilful ignorance of evil.
When or how John had learnt it I know
not, but certainly he had a rapid intuition
of the feelings of others; he could put himself<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
in their place, and to do that is to be
not harsh.</p>

<p>He looked again at Colonel Tempest,
and was ashamed of his passing, though
righteous, anger. He realized how hard it
must be for an older man to be obliged to
ask a young one for money, and he had
no wish to make it any harder. He looked
at the weak, wretched face, with its tortured
selfishness, and understood a little; perhaps
only in part, but enough to make him speak
again in a different tone.</p>

<p>"Do not tell me anything you do not
wish; but I see something is troubling
you very much. Sometimes things don't
look so black when one has talked them
over."</p>

<p>"I can't talk it over, John," said Colonel
Tempest, with incontestable veracity,
softened by the kindness of his tone, "but
the truth is," nervousness was shutting its<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
eyes and making a rush, "I want&mdash;<i>ten
thousand pounds and no questions asked</i>."</p>

<p>John was startled. Colonel Tempest
clutched his hat, and stared out of the
window. He felt benumbed. He had
actually done it, actually brought himself to
ask for it. As his faculties slowly returned
to him in the long silence which followed,
he became conscious, that if John was too
niggardly to pay his own ransom, he,
Colonel Tempest, would not be the most
to blame, if any casualty should hereafter
occur.</p>

<p>At last John spoke.</p>

<p>"You say you don't want any questions
asked, but I <i>must</i> ask one or two. You
want this money secretly. Would the want
of it bring disgrace upon your&mdash;children?"
He had nearly said your "daughter."</p>

<p>"If it was found out it would," said
Colonel Tempest, in a choked voice. The<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
detection, which he always told himself was
an impossibility, had, nevertheless, a horrible
way of masquerading before him at intervals
as an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>John knit his brows.</p>

<p>"I can't pretend not to know what it is,"
he said. "It is a debt of honour. You
have been betting."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Colonel Tempest, faintly.</p>

<p>"I suppose you can't touch your capital.
That is settled on your children."</p>

<p>"No," said Colonel Tempest. "There
were no settlements when I married. I had
to do the best I could. I had twenty
thousand pounds from my father, and my
wife brought me a few thousands after her
uncle's death; a very few, which her relations
could not prevent her having. But
there were the children, and one thing with
another, and women are extravagant, and
must have everything to their liking; and<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
by the time I had settled up and sold everything
after the break-up, it was all I could
do to put Archie to school."</p>

<p>(Oh! Di, Di, cold in your grave these
two and twenty years! Do you remember
the little pile of account books that you
wound up, and put in your writing-table
drawer, that last morning in April, thinking
that if anything happened, he would find
them there&mdash;afterwards. He had always
inveighed against the meanness of your
economy before the servants, and against
your extravagance in private. Do you remember
the butcher's book, with thin
blotting paper, that blotted tears as badly
as ink sometimes, for meat was dear; and
the milk bills? You were always proud
of the milk bills, with the space for cream
left blank, except when he was there. And
the little book of sundries, where those
quarter pounds of fresh butter and French<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
rolls, were entered, which Anne ran out to
get if he came home suddenly, because he
did not like the cheap butter from the Stores.
Do you remember these things? He
never knew, he never looked at the dumb
reproach of that little row of books: but I
cannot think, wherever you are, that you
have quite forgotten them.)</p>

<p>John was silent again. How could he
deal with this man who roused in him such
a vehement indignation? For several
minutes he could not trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>"I think I had better go," said Colonel
Tempest at last.</p>

<p>John started violently.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said. "Wait. Let me
think."</p>

<p>The nurse and his aunt came into the
room at that moment.</p>

<p>"Are not you feeling tired, sir?" the
nurse inquired, warningly.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, John," said Miss Fane, grunting as
her manner was. "Mustn't get tired."</p>

<p>"I am not," he replied. "Colonel Tempest
and I are discussing business matters
which won't wait&mdash;which it would trouble
me to leave unsettled. We have not quite
finished, but he is more tired than I am.
It is the hottest day we have had. Will
you give him a cup of tea, Aunt Flo, and
bring him back in half an hour."</p>

<p>When he was left alone John turned his
head painfully on the pillow, and slowly
opened and shut one of the bandaged hands.
This not altogether satisfactory form of
exercise was the only substitute he had
within his power for the old habit of pacing
up and down while he thought.</p>

<p>Ought he to give the money? He had
no right to make a bad use of anything
because he happened to have a good deal
of it. This ten thousand would follow the<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
previous twenty thousand, as a matter of
course.</p>

<p>Giving it did not affect himself, inasmuch
as he would hardly miss it. It was a
generous action only in appearance, for he
was very wealthy; even among the rich he
was very rich. His long minority, and
various legacies of younger branches, which
had shown the Tempest peculiarity of dying
out, and leaving their substance to the head
of the family, had added to an already imposing
income. In his present mode of life
he did not spend a third of it.</p>

<p>The thought flashed across his mind that
if he had died three weeks ago, if the hinges
of the door had held as firmly as the shot
lock, and he had perished in that room in
King Street like a rat in a trap, Colonel
Tempest would at this very moment have
been in possession of everything. He
looked at his own death, and all it would
have entailed, dispassionately.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[245]</span></p>

<p>That improvident selfish man had been
within an ace of immense wealth. And yet&mdash;John's
heart smote him&mdash;his uncle had
been genuinely grieved to see him so ill:
had been really thankful to think he was
out of danger. He had almost immediately
afterwards reverted to himself and his own
affairs; but that was natural to the man.
He had nevertheless been unaffectedly overcome
the moment before. The emotion had
been genuine.</p>

<p>John struggled hard against his strong
personal dislike.</p>

<p>Perhaps Colonel Tempest had become
entangled in the money difficulty at the very
time his&mdash;John's&mdash;life hung in the balance,
when he took for granted he was about to
inherit all. The speculation was heartless,
perhaps, but pardonable. John saw no
reason why Colonel Tempest should not
have counted on his death. For ten days<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
it had been more than probable; and now
he might live to a hundred. Perhaps the
probability of his reaching old age was
slenderer than he supposed.</p>

<p>He lay a little while longer and then rang
the bell near his hand, and directed his
servant to bring him a locked feminine
elegancy from a side-table which, until he
could replace his burnt possessions, had
evidently been lent him by his aunt to use
as a despatch-box. He got out a cheque-book,
and with clumsy fingers filled in and
signed a cheque. Then he lay back panting
and exhausted. The will was strong in him,
but the suffering body was desperately weak.</p>

<p>When Colonel Tempest returned, John
held the cheque towards him in silence with
a feeble smile.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest took it without speaking.
His lips shook. He was more moved than
he had been for years.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[247]</span></p>

<p>"God bless you, John," he said at last.
"You are a good fellow, and I don't deserve
it from you."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said John, in a more natural
tone of voice than he had yet used towards
him. "If you are at the polo match on
Thursday, will you look in and tell me how
it has gone? It would be a kindness to me.
I know Archie and Hemsworth are playing."
Colonel Tempest murmured something unintelligible,
and went out.</p>

<p>He did not go back at once to his rooms
in Brook Street. Almost involuntarily his
steps turned towards the Park. The world
was changed for him. The weary ceaseless
beat of the horses' hoofs on the wood pavement
had a cheerful exhilarating ring. All
the people looked glad. There was a confused
rejoicing in the rustle of the trees, in
the flying voices of the children playing and
rolling in the grass. He wandered down<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
towards the Serpentine. Dogs were rushing
in and out of the water. An elastic cockeared
retriever, undepressed by its doubtful
ancestry, was leaping and waving a wet tail at
its master, giving the short sharp barks of
youth and a light heart. An aristocratic pug
in a belled collar was delicately sniffing the
evening breeze across the water, watching
the antics of the lower orders with protruding
eyes like pieces of toffy rounded and glazed
by suction. An equally aristocratic black
poodle&mdash;Lindo out for a stroll with the valet&mdash;with
more social tendencies, was hurrying
up and down on the extreme verge, beckoning
rapidly with its short tufted tail to the
athletes in the water. The ducks bobbed
on the ripples. The children sprawled and
shouted and clambered. The low sun had
laid a dancing, glancing pathway across
the water. How glad it all was, how exceeding
glad! Colonel Tempest patted<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
one of the children on the head and felt
benevolent.</p>

<p>As he turned away at last and sauntered
homewards, he passed a little knot of people
gathered round a gesticulating open-air
preacher. Two girls, arm in arm, just in
front of him, were lounging near, talking
earnestly together.</p>

<p>"Sin no more lest a worse thing come
unto thee," bawled the strident fanatic voice.</p>

<p>"I shall have mine trimmed with tulle,
and a flower on the crown," said one of the
girls.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest walked slowly on. Yes,
yes; that was it. <i>Sin no more lest a worse
thing come unto thee.</i> He had always dreaded
that worse thing, and now that fear was all
over. He translated the cry of the preacher
into a message to himself, his first personal
transaction with the Almighty. He felt
awed. It was like a voice from another<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
world. Religion was becoming a reality to
him at last. There are still persons for
whom the Law and the Prophets are not
enough&mdash;who require that one should rise
from the dead to galvanize their superstition
into momentary activity. Sin no more. No&mdash;never
any more. He had done with sin. He
would make a fresh start from to-day, and
life would become easy and unembarrassed
and enjoyable once again; no more nightmares
and wakeful nights and nervous
haunting terrors. They were all finished
and put away. The tears came into his
eyes. He regretted that he had not enjoyed
these comfortable feelings earlier in life.
The load was lifted from his heart, and the
removal of the pain was like a solemn joy.</p>

<span class="hide">O</span>N the paths of self-interest the grass is
seldom allowed to grow under the
feet. Colonel Tempest hurried. It would
be tedious to follow the various steps
feverishly taken which led to his finally
unearthing the home address of Mr. Swayne.
He procured it at last, not without expense,
from an impoverished client of that gentleman
who had lately been in correspondence with
him. Mr. Swayne had always shown a
decided reticence with regard to the locality<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
of his domestic roof. Colonel Tempest was
of course in possession of several addresses
where letters would find him, but his experience
of such addresses had been that, unless
strictly connected with pecuniary advantage
to Mr. Swayne, the letters did not seem to
reach their destination. But now, even when
Colonel Tempest wrote to say he would pay
up, no answer came. Swayne did not rise
even to that bait. Colonel Tempest, who
was aware that Mr. Swayne's faith in human
nature had in the course of his career sustained
several severe shocks, came to the conclusion
that Mr. Swayne did not attach importance
to his statement&mdash;that indeed he regarded it
only as a "blind" in order to obtain another
interview.</p>

<p>It was on a burning day in June that
Colonel Tempest set forth to search out his
tempter at Rosemont Villa, Iron Ferry, in
the manufacturing town of Bilgewater. The<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
dirty smudged address was in his pocket-book,
as was also the notice of his banker
that ten thousand pounds had been placed to
his credit a few days before.</p>

<p>The London train took him to Worcester,
and from thence the local line, after meandering
through a desert of grime and chimneys,
and after innumerable stoppages at one
hideous nigger station after another, finally
deposited him on the platform of Bilgewater
Junction. Colonel Tempest got out and
looked about him. It was not a rural scene.
Heaps of refuse and slag lay upon the
blistered land thick as the good resolutions
that pave a certain road. Low cottages
crowded each other in knots near the high
smoking factories. Black wheels turned
slowly against the grey of the sky, which
whitened upwards towards the ghost of the
midsummer sun high in heaven. We are
told that the sun shines equally on the just<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
and on the unjust; but that was said before
the first factory was built. At Bilgewater it
is no longer so.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest inquired his way to Iron
Ferry, and, vaguely surprised at Mr.
Swayne's choice of locality for his country
residence, set out along the baked wrinkles
of the black high-road, winding between
wastes of cottages, some inhabited and showing
dreary signs of life, some empty and
decrepit, some fallen down dead. The heat
was intense. The steam and the smoke
rose together into the air like some evil
sacrifice. The pulses of the factories
throbbed feverishly as he passed. The
steam curled upwards from the surface of the
livid pools and canals at their base. The
very water seemed to sweat.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest reached Iron Ferry,
being guided thither by the spire of the little
tin church, which pointed unheeded towards<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
the low steel sky, shut down over the
battered convulsed country like a coffin lid
over one who has died in torment.</p>

<p>At Iron Ferry, which had a bridge and a
wharf and a canal, and was everything
except a ferry, he inquired again concerning
Rosemont Villa, and was presently picking
his way across a little patch of common
towards a string of what had once been red
brick houses, but which had long since
embraced the universal colour of their
surroundings. They were rather better
looking houses if a sort of shabby gentility
can be called anything except the worst.
They were semi-detached. From out of
one of them the strains were issuing faintly
and continuously of the inevitable accordion,
which for some occult reason is always
found to consort with poverty and oyster-shells.</p>

<p>At the open door of another a girl was<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
standing tearing pieces with her teeth out of
a chunk of something she held in her hand.
She was surrounded by a meagre family of
poultry who fought and pecked and trod
each other down with almost human eagerness
for the occasional morsels she threw to
them. Something in her appearance and in
the way she seemed to enjoy the greed and
mutual revilings of her little dependents
reminded Colonel Tempest&mdash;he hardly knew
why&mdash;of Mr. Swayne.</p>

<p>Another glance made the supposition a
certainty. There were the small boot-buttons
of eyes, the heavy mottled expressionless
face, which Colonel Tempest had
until now considered to be the exclusive
property of Mr. Swayne. This slouching,
tawdry down-at-heel arrow was no doubt one
of that gentleman's quiverful.</p>

<p>Mr. Swayne had always worn such very
unmarried waistcoats and button holes that it<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
was a shock to Colonel Tempest to regard
him as a domestic character.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Swayne at home?" he asked,
amid the cackling and flouncing of the
poultry.</p>

<p>The "arrow," her cheek "bulged with the
unchewed piece," looked at him doubtfully
for a moment, and then called over her
shoulder&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>The voice as of a female who had never
been held in subjection answered shrilly from
within&mdash;"Well?"</p>

<p>"Here's a gent as wants to see father."</p>

<p>There was a sound of some heavy vessel
being set down, and a woman, large and
swarthy, came to the door. She might have
been good-looking once. She might perhaps
have been "a fine figure of a woman" in the
days when Swayne wooed and won her, and
no doubt her savings, for his own. But<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
possibly the society of Mr. Swayne may not
in the long run have exerted an ennobling or
even a soothing influence upon her. Her
complexion was a fiery red, and her whole
appearance bespoke a temperament to which
the artificial stimulus of alcohol, though evidently
unnecessary, was evidently not denied.</p>

<p>"Swayne's sick," she said, eyeing Colonel
Tempest with distrust. "He can't see no
one, and if he could, there's not a shilling in
the house if you was to scrape the walls with
a knife&mdash;so that's all about it. It's no
manner of use coming pestering here for
money."</p>

<p>"I don't want money," said Colonel Tempest.
"I want to pay, not to be paid."</p>

<p>The woman shook her head incredulously,
and put out her under lip, uttering the mystic
word, "Walker!" It did not seem to bear
upon the subject, but somebody, probably
the accordion next door, laughed.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[259]</span></p>

<p>"I must see him!" said Colonel Tempest,
vehemently. "I've had dealings with him
which I want to settle and have done with.
It's my own interest to pay up. He would
see me directly if he knew I was here."</p>

<p>The woman hesitated.</p>

<p>"Swayne is uncommon sick," she said,
slowly. "If it's business I doubt he could
scarce fettle at it now."</p>

<p>"Do you mean he is not sober?"</p>

<p>"He's sober enough, poor fellow," said
Mrs. Swayne, with momentary sympathy;
"but he's mortal bad. He hasn't done
nobbut but dithered with a bit of toast since
Tuesday, and taking it out of hisself all the
time with flouncing and swearing like a brute
beast."</p>

<p>"Is he&mdash;do you mean to say he is
<i>dying</i>?" demanded Colonel Tempest in
sudden panic.</p>

<p>"Doctor says he won't hang on above a<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
day or two," said the girl nonchalantly.
"Doctor says his works is clean wore out."</p>

<p>"Let me go to him at once," said Colonel
Tempest. "It is of great importance; I
must see him at once."</p>

<p>The women stared at each other undecidedly,
and the girl nudged her mother.</p>

<p>"Lor, mother, what does it signify? If
the gentleman 'ull make it worth while,
show him up."</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest hastily produced a sovereign,
and in a few minutes was stumbling
up the rickety stairs behind Mrs. Swayne.
She pushed open a half-closed door, and
noisily pulled back a bit of curtain which
shaded the light&mdash;what poor dim light there
was&mdash;from the bed, knocking over as she
did so a tallow candle in the window-sill
bent double by the heat.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest had followed her into
the room and into an atmosphere resembling<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
that of the monkey-house at the Zoo, stiffened
with brandy.</p>

<p>"Oh, good gracious!" he ejaculated, as
Mrs. Swayne drew back the curtain. "Oh
dear, Mrs. Swayne! I ought to have been
prepared. I had no idea&mdash;&mdash; What's the
matter with him? What is he writing on
the wall?"</p>

<p>For Mr. Swayne was changed. He was
within a measurable distance of being unrecognizable.
That evidently would be the
next alteration not for the better in him.
Already he was slow to recognize others.
He was sitting up in bed, swearing and
scratching tearfully at the wall-paper. He
looked stouter than ever, but as if he might
collapse altogether at a pin prick, and shrivel
down to a wrinkled nothing among the
creases of his tumbled bedding.</p>

<p>Mrs. Swayne regarded her prostrate lord
with arms akimbo. Possibly she considered<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
that her part of the agreement, to love and
to cherish Mr. Swayne, and honour and
obey Mr. Swayne, was now at an end, as
death was so plainly about to part them.
At any rate, she appeared indisposed to add
any finishing touches to her part of the contract.
Mr. Swayne had, in all probability,
put in his finishing touches with such vigour,
that possibly a remembrance of them accounted
for a certain absence of solicitude
on the part of his helpmeet.</p>

<p>"Who's this? Who's this? Who's this?"
said Mr. Swayne in a rapid whisper, perceiving
his visitor, and peering out of the
gloom with a bloodshot furtive eye. "Dear,
dear, dear! ... Mary ... I'm busy ...
I'm pressed for time. Take him away.
Quite away; quite away."</p>

<p>Mr. Swayne had been a man of few and
evil words when in health. His recording
angel would now need a knowledge of short<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>hand.
This sudden flow of language fairly
staggered Colonel Tempest.</p>

<p>"I must have out those bonds," he went
on, forgetting his visitor again instantly. "I
can't lay my hand on 'em, but I've got 'em
somewhere. Top left-hand drawer of the
walnut escritoire. I know I have 'em. I'll
make him bleed. Top left-hand. No, no,
no. Where was it, then? Lock's stiff;&mdash;&mdash;
the lock. Break it. I say I will have 'em."</p>

<p>As he spoke he tore from under the pillow
a little footstool, having the remnant of a
frayed dog, in blue beads, worked upon it,
a conjugal attention no doubt on the part of
Mrs. Swayne, to raise the sick man's head.</p>

<p>And Mr. Swayne, after endeavouring to
unlock the dog's tail, smote savagely upon
it, and sank back with chattering teeth.</p>

<p>"That's the way he goes on," said Mrs.
Swayne. "Mornin', noon, and night. Never
a bit of peace, except when he gets into his<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
prayin' fits. I expect he'll go off in one of
them tantrums."</p>

<p>It did not appear unlikely that he would
"go off" then and there, but after a few
moments a sort of ghastly life seemed to
return. Even death did not appear to take
to him. He opened his eyes, and looked
round bewildered. Then his head fell
forward.</p>

<p>"Now's yer time," said the woman.
"Before he gets up steam for another of
them rages. Parson comes and twitters a
bit when he's in this way; and he'll pray
very heavy while he recollects hisself, until
he goes off again. He'll be better now for
a spell," and she left the room, and creaked
ponderously downstairs again. Colonel
Tempest advanced a step nearer the lair on
which poor Swayne was taking his last rest
but one, and said faintly:</p>

<p>"Swayne. I say, Swayne. Rouse up."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[265]</span></p>

<p>The only things that roused up were
Swayne's eyelids. These certainly trembled
a little.</p>

<p>In the next house the accordion was beginning
a new tune, was designating Jerusalem
as its ha-appy home.</p>

<p>Apprehensive terror for himself as usual
overcame other feelings. It overcame in
this instance the unspeakable repugnance
Colonel Tempest felt to approaching any
nearer. He touched the prostrate man on
the shoulder with the slender white hand
which had served him so exclusively from
boyhood upwards, which had never wavered
in its fidelity to him to do a hand's turn
for others, which shrinkingly did his bidding
now.</p>

<p>"Wake up, Swayne," repeated Colonel
Tempest, actually stooping over him.
"Wake up, for&mdash;&mdash;," he was going to add
"heaven's sake;" but the thought of heaven<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
in connection with Swayne seemed inappropriate;
and he altered it to "for mercy's
sake," which sounded just as well.</p>

<p>"Is it the parson?" asked Swayne feebly,
in a more natural voice.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Colonel Tempest reassuringly.
"It's only me, a friend. It's Colonel
Tempest."</p>

<p>"I wish it <i>was</i> the parson," repeated
Swayne, seeming to emerge somewhat from
his torpor. "He might have come and let
off a few more prayers for me. He says it's
all right if I repent, and I suppose he knows;
but it don't seem likely. Don't seem as if
God <i>could</i> be greened quite as easy as parson
makes out. I should have liked to throw
off a few more prayers so as to be on the
safe side," and he began to mutter incoherently.</p>

<p>As a man lives so, it is said, he generally
dies. Swayne seemed to remain true to his<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
own interests, only his aspect of those
interests had altered. He felt the awkwardness
of going into court absolutely unprepared.
Prayer was cheap if it could do what he
wanted, and he had had professional advice
as to its efficacy. A man who all his life
can grovel before his fellow-creatures, may
as well do a little grovelling before his
Creator at the last, if anything is to be got
by it.</p>

<p>It is to the credit of human nature that,
as a rule, men even of the lowest type feel
the uselessness, the degradation, of trying
to annul their past on their deathbeds. But
to Swayne, who had never shone as a credit
to human nature, a chance remained a chance.
He was a gambler and a swindler, a man
who had risked long odds, and had been
made rich and poor by the drugging of a
horse, or the forcing of a card. If, in his
strict attention to never losing a chance, he<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
had inadvertently mislaid his soul, he was
not likely to be aware of it. But a <i>chance</i>
was a thing he had never so far failed to
take advantage of. He was taking his last
now.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest looked at him in horror.
The interests of the two men clashed, and
at a vital moment.</p>

<p>"For God's sake don't pray now, Swayne,"
said Colonel Tempest, appealingly, as Swayne
began to mutter something more. "I've
come to set wrong right, and that will be a
great deal better than any prayers; do you
more good in the end."</p>

<p>Swayne did not seem to understand. He
looked in a perplexed manner at Colonel
Tempest.</p>

<p>"I don't appear to fetch it out right," he
said. "But it's in the Prayer-book on the
mantelpiece. That's what our parson reads
out of. You get it, colonel; just get it quick,<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
and pray 'em off one after another. It don't
matter much which. They're all good."</p>

<p>"Swayne," said Colonel Tempest, in utter
desperation, "I'll do anything; I'll&mdash;pray
as much as you like afterwards, if you will
only give me up those papers you have
against me&mdash;those bets."</p>

<p>"What?" said Swayne, a gleam of the old
professional interest flickering into his face.
"You han't got the money?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Here, here!" and Colonel Tempest
tore the banker's note out of his pocket-book,
and held it before Swayne's eyes.</p>

<p>"I was to have had twenty-five per cent.
commission," said Swayne, rallying perceptibly
at the thought. "Twenty-five per
cent. on each. I wouldn't let 'em go at less.
Two thousand five hundred I should have
made. But"&mdash;with a sudden restless relapse&mdash;"it's
no use thinking of that now. Get
down the book, colonel."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[270]</span></p>

<p>But for once Colonel Tempest was firm.</p>

<p>Perhaps his indignation against Swayne's
egotism enabled him to be so. He made
Swayne understand that business must in
this instance come first, and prayers afterwards.
It was a compact; not the first
between the two.</p>

<p>"The papers," he repeated over and over
again, frantic at the speed with which the
last links of Swayne's memory seemed falling
from him. "Where are they? You have
them with you, of course? Tell me where
they are?" and he grasped the dying man
by the shoulder.</p>

<p>Swayne was frightened back to some
semblance of effort.</p>

<p>"I haven't got 'em," he gasped. "The&mdash;the&mdash;the
chaps engaged in the business have
'em."</p>

<p>"But you know who have got them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. It's all written down
somewhere."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[271]</span></p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>But Swayne "did not rightly know." He
had the addresses in cipher somewhere, but
he could not put his hand upon them. Half
wild with fear, Colonel Tempest searched the
pockets of the clothes that lay about the
room, holding up their contents for Swayne
to look at. It was like some hideous game
of hide-and-seek. But the latter only shook
his head.</p>

<p>"I have 'em somewhere," he repeated,
"and there was a change not so long ago.
When was it? May. There's one of 'em
written down in cipher in my pocket-book
in May, I know that."</p>

<p>"Here. This one?" said Colonel Tempest,
holding out a greasy pocket-book.</p>

<p>"That's it," said Swayne. "Some time
in May."</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest turned to the month,
and actually found a page with a faint pencil
scrawl in cipher across it.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[272]</span></p>

<p>"That's him," said Swayne. "James
Larkin," and he read out a complicated
address without difficulty.</p>

<p>"Will that find him?" asked Colonel
Tempest, his hand shaking so much that he
could hardly write down Swayne's words.</p>

<p>"If it's to his advantage it will."</p>

<p>"For certain?"</p>

<p>"Certain."</p>

<p>"And the others?"</p>

<p>"There's one dead," said Swayne, his voice
waxing feebler and feebler as the momentary
galvanism of Colonel Tempest's terror lost
its effect. "And there's two I had back
the papers from; they were sick of it, and
they said he had a charmed life. And one
of 'em went to America, and married, and
set up respectable. I have his paper too.
And one of 'em's in quod, but he'll be out
soon, I reckon, and he's good for another
try. He precious near brought it off last<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
time. There's a few left that's still biding
their time! There! And now I won't hear
nothin' more about it. Get to the prayers,
Colonel, and be quick. Parson might have
come again, damn him."</p>

<p>"Stop a minute. Can I get at the others
through Larkin?"</p>

<p>Swayne had sunk back spent and livid.
He looked at Colonel Tempest with fixed
and glassy eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, with the ghost of an oath;
"get to the prayers."</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest was still trembling with
the relief from that horrible nightmare of
suspense as he opened the shiny new Prayer-book
which the clergyman had left. He
held the first link. He had now only to
draw the whole chain through his hand, and
break it to atoms; the chain that was dragging
him down to hell. He hastily began
to read.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[274]</span></p>

<p>God has heard many prayers, but, perhaps,
not many like those which ascended from
that hideous tumbled death-bed, where kneeling
self-interest halted through the supplication,
and prostrate self-interest gasped out
Amen.</p>

<p>Oh! did He who first taught us how to
pray, did He, raised high upon the cross of
an apparent failure, look down the ages that
were yet to come, and see how we should
abuse that gift of prayer? Was that bitter
cry which has echoed through eighteen
hundred years wrung from Him even for
our sakes also as well as those who stood
around Him&mdash;"Father, forgive them, for
they know not what they do"?</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest was still on his knees
when the door was softly opened, and a
young, a very young, clergyman came in and
knelt down beside him, clasping his thin
hands over the collapsed felt <i>souffl&eacute;e</i> which<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
did duty for a hat. After stumbling to the
end of the prayer he was reading, Colonel
Tempest put the book into his hand and
escaped.</p>

<p>He stole down the stairs and past the
little sitting-room unobserved. He was out
again in the open air, the live free air,
which seemed freshness itself after the atmosphere
of that sick-room. He held the clue.
He had it, he held it, he was safe. God
was on his side now, and was helping him to
make restitution. At one despairing moment
when he had been tearing even the linings
out of the pockets of Swayne's check trousers
he had feared that Providence had deserted
him. Now that he had the pocket-book he
regretted his want of faith. I do not think
his mind reverted once to Swayne, for Swayne
was no longer of any interest to him now
that he was out of Swayne's power. Colonel
Tempest did not exactly forget people, but<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
his mind was so constituted that everything
with which it came in contact was wiped out
the moment it had ceased to affect or group
itself round himself. His imagination did
not follow his colleague's last faltering steps
upon that steep brink where each must one
day stand. His mind turned instinctively
to the most frivolous subjects, was back in
London wondering what he would have had
for dinner if he had dined with Archie as he
had intended; was anxious to know how
many cigarettes of that new brand he had
put into his case before he left London that
morning. Colonel Tempest stopped, and
got out his cigarette-case and counted them.</p>

<p>Those who had known Colonel Tempest
best, those few who had misunderstood and
loved him, had often pondered with grave
anxiety, or with the wistful perplexity of
wounded affection, as to what it was in him
that being so impressionable was yet incapable<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
of any real impression. His wife may or
may not have mastered that expensive secret.
At any rate, she had had opportunities of
studying it. When first, a few weeks after
her marriage, she had fallen ill, she, poor
fool, had suffered agonies from the fear that
because he hardly came into her sick-room
after the first day, he had ceased to care for
her. But when after a few days more she
was feeling better and was pretty and interesting
again in a pink wrapper on the
sofa, she had found that he was as devoted
to her as ever, and had confided her foolish
dread to him with happy tears. Possibly
she discovered at last that the secret lay not
so much in the selfishness and self-indulgence
of a character moth-eaten by idleness, as
in the instant and invariable recoil of the
mind from any subject that threatened to
prove disagreeable, the determination to avoid
everything irksome, wearisome, or reproachful.<span class="pagenum">[278]</span>
For a moment, while it was quite new,
a sentiment might be indulged in. But as
soon as a certain novelty and pleasure in
emotion ceased the feeling itself was
shirked, at whatever expense to others.
Those who shirk are ill to live with, and lay
up for themselves an increasing loneliness as
life goes on.</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest found it unpleasant to
think about Swayne, so he thought of something
else. He could always do that unless
he himself was concerned. Then, indeed, as
we have seen, it was a different thing. He
was annoyed when, after slowly picking his
way back to the station, he found the last
passenger train had just gone; that even if
he drove fifteen miles in to Worcester he
should be too late to catch the last express to
London; in fact, that there was nothing for
it but a bed at the station inn. He found,
however, that by making a very early start<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
from Bilgewater the following morning he
could reach London by noon, and so resigned
himself to his lot with composure. He had
hardly expected he should be able to go and
return in one day.</p>

<p>It was indeed early when he walked across
to the station next morning, so early that
there was a suspicion of freshness in the air,
of colour in the eastern sky.</p>

<p>On a heap of slag a motionless figure was
sitting, black against the sky line, looking
towards the east. It was the curate, who
when he perceived Colonel Tempest, came
crunching and flapping in his long coat tails
down to the road below, raised his hat from
a meagre clerical brow, and held out his
hand. His face was thin and poor, suggestive
of a starved mind and cold mutton and
Pearson on the Creed, but the smile redeemed
it.</p>

<p>"It is all over," he said; "half an hour<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
ago. Quite quietly at the last. I stayed
with him through the night. I never left
him. We prayed together without ceasing."</p>

<p>Colonel Tempest did not know what to say.</p>

<p>"It was too late to go to bed," continued
the young man impulsively, his face working.
"So I came here. I often come and sit on
that ash heap to see the sun rise. I'm so
glad just to have seen you again. I longed
to thank you for those prayers by poor Mr.
Crosbie's bed. You know the Scripture:
'Where two or three are gathered together.'
I felt it was so true. I have lost heart so of
late. No one seems to care or think about
these things down here. But your coming
and praying like that has been such a help,
such a reproach to me for my want of faith
when I think that the seed falls on the rock.
I shall take courage again now. Ah! You
are going by this train? Good-bye, God
bless you! Thank you again."</p>

<span class="hide">A</span>S John slowly climbed the hill of convalescence
many visitors came to
relieve his solitude, and one of those who
came the oftenest was Lord Frederick Fane.</p>

<p>Lord Frederick was a square-shouldered,
well-preserved, well set up, carefully-padded
man of close on sixty, with a thin-lipped,
bloodless face, and faded eyes, divided by a
high nose.</p>

<p>"Do you like that man?" said Lord
Hemsworth to John one day when he was
sitting with him, and Lord Frederick sent<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
up to know whether the latter would see
him.</p>

<p>"No," said John.</p>

<p>"But you seem to see a good deal of him."</p>

<p>"He is civil to me, and I am not rude to
him. He is a relation, you know."</p>

<p>"I can't stand him," said Lord Hemsworth.
"If he is coming up I shall bolt;" and Lord
Frederick entering at that moment, Lord
Hemsworth took his departure.</p>

<p>"You're better, John," said Lord Frederick,
looking at him through his half-closed eyes,
and settling himself gently in a high chair,
his hat and one glove and crutch-handled
stick held before him in his broad lean hand.</p>

<p>"I feel more human," said John, "now
that I'm shaved and dressed. When I saw
myself in the glass yesterday for the first
time, I thought I was Darwin's missing
link."</p>

<p>"You look more human," said Lord<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
Frederick, crossing one leg over the other,
and then contemplating his white spats for
a change. "Able to attend to business
again yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I have tried, but I am as
weak as a worm that can't turn."</p>

<p>"Pity," said Lord Frederick, glancing at
a sheaf of letters and some opened telegrams
on the table at John's elbow. "Things
always happen at inconvenient times," he
went on. "Old Charlesworth might have
chosen a more opportune moment to die and
leave Marchamley vacant again."</p>

<p>"He is not dead yet."</p>

<p>"I suppose both sides have been at you
already to stand for it yourself," hazarded
Lord Frederick.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I thought so."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Are you going to stand?"</p><p><span class="pagenum">[284]</span></p>

<p>"What is your opinion on the subject? I
see you have one."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lord Frederick, "I look at
it this way. I have often said 'Don't tie
yourself.' I am all for young men keeping
their hands free, and seeing the ins and outs
of life, before they settle down. But you
are not so very young, and a time comes
when a sort of annoyance attaches to freedom
itself. It's a bore. Now as to this seat.
Indecision is all very well for a time; it
enhances a man's value. You were quite
right not to stand three years ago; it has
made you of more importance. But that
won't do much longer. You are bound to
come to a decision for your own advantage.
Neutral ground is sometimes between two
fires. I should say 'stand,' if you ask me.
Throw in your lot with the side on which
you are most likely to come to the front, and
stand."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[285]</span></p>

<p>"And private opinions? How about them
if they don't happen to fit? Throw them
overboard?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lord Frederick. "It has
got to be done sooner or later. Why not
sooner? A free-lance is no manner of use.
There's a hitch somewhere in you, John,
that if you don't look out will damn your
career as a public man. I don't know what
your politics are. My own opinion, between
ourselves, is that you have not got any, but
you are bound to have some, and you may
as well join forces with what will bring
you forward most, and start young. That's
my advice."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>"There is not a man in the world with an
ounce of brains who has not high-flown ideas
at your age," continued Lord Frederick.
"I have had them. Everybody has them.
You buy them with your first razors. People<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
generally sicken with them just when they
could make a push for themselves, and while
they are getting better, youth and opportunity
pass and don't come back. I've seen it over
and over again. Every young fool with a
ginger moustache, when he first starts in
public life, is going to be a patriot, and do
his d&mdash;d thinking for himself. He might as
well make his own clothes, and expect society
to receive him in them. By the time he is
bald he has learnt better, and he's a party
man, but he has lost time in the meanwhile.
You may depend upon it, a strong party man
is what is wanted. The country doesn't
want individuals with brains; they are mostly
kicked out in the end. If you don't want to
go with the crowd, don't go against it, but
throw yourself into it heart and soul, and
get in front of it on its own road. It's no
good coming to the fore unless you have a
following."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[287]</span></p>

<p>"Thanks," said John again. His face
was as expressionless as a mask. He
looked, as he lay back in his low couch, a
strange mixture of feebleness and power. It
was as if a strong man armed kept watch
within a house tottering to its fall.</p>

<p>He put out his muscular, powerless hand,
and took up one of the telegrams.</p>

<p>"Charlesworth is not dead yet," he said.</p>

<p>Lord Frederick could take a hint.</p>

<p>"His death will put the Moretons in
mourning again," he remarked. "Mrs.
Moreton's ball is doomed. I am sorry for
that woman. She is cumbered with much
time-serving, and her ball fell through last
year; this is the second time it has happened.
I have been asking her young men for her.
I put down your cousin in the Guards, the
Apollo with the tow wig. What's-his-name,
Tempest?"</p>

<p>"Archibald."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[288]</span></p>

<p>"Yes. That would be a dangerous man,
if he were not such a fool, but the same
placard that says he is to let says he is
unfurnished, and it's poor work taking an
empty house, when it comes to living in it.
Women know that. He has let the soda
water heiress slip through his fingers. She
is going to marry young Topham. I
thought Apollo seemed rather down on his
luck when it was first given out, but he has
consoled himself since. Apparently he has
a mission to married women. He is always
with Lady Verelst now; I saw him riding
with her again this morning. I don't know
who mounts him, but he was on the best
horse I've seen this season. You are not
such a f&mdash;&mdash;, such a philanthropist as to lend
him horses, are you?"</p>

<p>"When I can't use them myself I have
that amount of generosity."</p>

<p>"H'm! Well, he makes good use of his<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
opportunities to cheer up Lady Verelst. I
wish you would flirt more with married
women, John. You would find your account
in it. I did at your age. You see you are
too eligible to go on much with girls, and
that's the truth. You would be watched.
But you don't pay enough attention to
women, and three-quarters of the world is
made up of them. You are too much of a
Puritan, but you may remember human
nature is like a short-footed stocking. If
you darn it up at the heel it will come out at
the toe. It's no manner of use to ignore
women. People who do always come the
worst croppers in the end. A flirtation with
a fast, married woman would peel your illusions
off you like the skin off an orange.
All young men believe in women&mdash;till they
know them. He! He! If I were a rabbit
I should take a personal interest in the
habits of birds of prey. I told Hemsworth<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
something of the kind the other day, but
he is bent on making a fool of himself."</p>

<p>"He knows his own affairs best."</p>

<p>"I fancy I know them better than he
does. Miss Di is young, but she is uncommonly
well aware of her own value, and
she is looking higher. I should not wonder
if she tried to marry you. She'll take him
in five years' time, if he is still willing, and
she outstands her market: but in the mean
time she keeps him dangling. I told him
so, and that I admired her for it. She
holds her head high, but she is a splendid
creature, and no mistake. She has not that
expectant anxious look about her that you
see in other girls, and she is not made up.
It's sterling good looks in her case. If
you are interested in that quarter, you may
take my word for it, it is all genuine, even
to her hair. That is why her frank manner
is so telling; it's of a piece with the rest.<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
She knows how to play her cards. The
old woman has taught her a thing or two."</p>

<p>"What a knowledge you have of&mdash;human
nature."</p>

<p>"I have looked about," said Lord
Frederick, rising as gently as he had sat
down, and pulling up his shirt collar. "I
had my eyes opened pretty young, and I
have kept them open ever since. Glad
you're better. That black devil in tights
of a poodle wants shaving as much as
you did last time I saw you. No, don't
ring for that melancholy valet. I will let
myself out. I dare say I shall be in again
in the course of a day or two. Ta, ta."</p>

<p>John crushed the telegram he was still
holding into a hard ball as soon as his self-constituted
guide, philosopher, and friend
had left the room.</p>

<p>Cynicism was not new to him. It is cheap
enough to be universally appropriated by<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
the poor in spirit, for whom generosity and
tolerance are commodities too expensive to
be indulged in. Our belief in human nature
is a foot rule, by which we may be accurately
measured ourselves. There are those in
whose enlightened eyes, purity herself is
only a courtesan in fancy dress. John had
already had many teachers, for he was a
man who was being educated regardless of
expense; but perhaps to no two persons did
he owe so much as to Mr. Goodwin and
Lord Frederick Fane. Our elders act as
danger-signals oftener than they know.</p>

<p>John's room looked out across the Park.
His couch had been drawn near the open
window, and to lie and watch the passing
crowd of carriages and pedestrians was
almost as much excitement as he could bear
after the darkened rooms and enforced quiet
of the last few weeks. John, with Lindo
erect on the vacant chair beside him, saw<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>
Lord Frederick's hansom, with his pale
profile inside it, turn down Park Lane below
his windows. Pain had burned all John's
energy out of him for the time, and he had
soon forgotten his annoyance in watching
the people attempting to cross the thoroughfare,
and in counting the omnibuses that
passed. It was all he was up to. It was
about five in the afternoon, and carriage
after carriage turned into the Park at the
gates opposite his window. There went
Lady Delmour with her brand new daughter,
a sweet, wild rose from the country, that
must be perfected by London smuts and
gaslight. John pointed her out to Lindo,
but he only yawned and looked the other
way. There was Mrs. Barker walking with
her husband. Those two white parasols he
had danced with somewhere, but he could
not put a name to them. Neither could
Lindo when asked. Another red omnibus.<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>
That was the tenth red one within the last
half-hour. Royalty went flashing by, bowing
and bowed to. John obliged Lindo, whom
he suspected of democratic tendencies, to
make a bow also. He hoped his nurse
would not come in and send him back to bed
yet. It was really very interesting watching
the passers-by. Was that&mdash;no, it was not&mdash;yes,
it was Lady Verelst with red parasol
and husband to match, in the victoria with
the greys. There was actually Duchess, his
old polo pony whom he had not seen since
he sold her three years ago, looking as spry
as ever. John craned his neck to see the
last of the bob-tail of his old favourite
whisk round the corner. A moment later
Mrs. Courtenay and Di, erect and fair beside
her, spun past in the opposite direction.
Before he had time to realize that he had
seen her, almost before he had recognized
her, the momentary glimpse struck him like<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
a blow. His head swam, his heart, so
languid the moment before, leapt up and
struggled like a maddened caged animal.
She had passed some time before he was
conscious of anything but the one fact that
he had seen her.</p>

<p>He stumbled to his feet and walked unsteadily
across the room, clutching at the
furniture. He seemed to have left his legs
behind.</p>

<p>"What am I doing?" he said to himself
half aloud, holding on to and swaying against
a table. "What has happened? Why did
I get up?"</p>

<p>He dragged himself back to his couch
again, and sank down exhausted. The excursion
had been too much for him. He
had not walked so far before. He was
bewildered.</p>

<p>Through the open window came the jingle,
and the "clip-clop" and the hum. Another<span class="pagenum">[296]</span>
red omnibus passed. But there was a loud
knocking at the door of John's heart that
deafened him to all beside; the peremptory
knocking as of one armed with a claim, who
stood without and would not be denied.</p>

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
